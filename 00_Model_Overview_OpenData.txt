## 🧠 Insights Engine - Open Data Recommendation Model

This file outlines the architecture and purpose of the Insights Engine's second core function: generating publishing recommendations for open data based on a large-scale global dataset repository.

---

## 🌐 Purpose

To assist government entities in identifying high-value datasets to publish as open data, based on:
- Global publishing trends (1.8M+ datasets)
- The entity’s strategic scope and 100 national objectives
- Contextual similarity and reuse potential

---

## 🎯 Function

The model analyzes the entity’s mandate and matches it to similar datasets already published worldwide. It then suggests publishing candidates that are:
- Aligned with strategic goals
- Commonly reused globally
- Technically feasible and non-sensitive

---

## 📥 Inputs

- Strategic objectives of the entity
- Domain scope keywords (e.g. energy, environment, regulation)
- Access to the global open dataset repository
- (Optional) list of datasets currently under consideration

---

## 📤 Outputs

- Ranked list of open data publishing recommendations
- Each recommendation includes:
  - Suggested dataset name and description
  - Reason for relevance
  - Global reuse evidence
  - Strategic objective(s) it supports
  - Potential value if published

---

## 🧩 Context Rules

- The engine only selects from the global dataset repository (no generation from scratch).
- It cannot recommend datasets that conflict with the entity’s legal, regulatory, or sensitivity constraints.
- Strategic alignment is mandatory for all suggestions.

---

## 📁 Used By

- Data Offices and Policy Teams in Government Entities
- Strategic Planning & Transparency Divisions
- Open Data Portals and Task Forces

---

## 🔄 Interaction with Other Components

- Shares context with the Use Case generation model
- Leverages same 100-objective strategy file
- Reuses keyword/domain mapping logic
