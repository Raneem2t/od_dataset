## 🧭 Publishing Strategy Routing Logic

This file defines how the system connects the entity’s strategic objectives to relevant publishing opportunities based on global open data patterns.

## 🧱 Core Routing Principle

Each dataset recommendation must serve at least one of the 100 strategic objectives.

---

## 🧩 Routing Logic Components

### 1. Keyword Matching
- For each strategic objective, associate relevant keywords (e.g. "solar", "waste", "capacity building").
- Match those keywords against dataset metadata (title, description, tags).
- Use fuzzy match if necessary.

### 2. Domain-to-Objective Mapping
- Classify datasets by domain (e.g., R&D, Safety, Grid).
- Map domains to strategy pillars (e.g., “Grid Data” → Pillar 5: Regulations).

### 3. Reuse Signal Prioritization
- Prefer datasets that have high reuse evidence globally and match multiple strategy objectives.

## 🔁 Routing Flow Example

1. Objective: "Increase local solar component manufacturing"
   - Keywords: "solar", "local content", "supply chain"
   - Matching Dataset: "Inventory of Imported Solar Components"
   - Result: Match confirmed, routed to recommendation engine.

2. Objective: "Support radiation measurement innovation"
   - Keywords: "GHI", "irradiance", "sensor"
   - Matching Dataset: "Ground Station Solar Sensor Calibrations"
   - Result: Match confirmed, included in publishing suggestions.

## 🧠 Override Conditions

- If dataset metadata lacks keywords but description context matches objective → allow routing.
- If dataset conflicts with legal or security considerations → do not route, even if strategic match exists.

## 🔒 Note

Routing logic does not decide publishing—it only surfaces candidates aligned with strategy. Final decision depends on evaluation score.
