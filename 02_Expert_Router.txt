## 🔀 Expert Router Overview

The Expert Router is a central component of the Insights Engine MoE architecture. It is responsible for intelligently selecting which expert(s) should handle a specific dataset input based on contextual understanding.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- To route each dataset to the most relevant expert(s) based on its content and strategic alignment.
- To reduce unnecessary computation by activating only the required experts.
- To improve precision and relevance in the generated outputs (use cases or recommendations).

---

## 🧠 How It Works

### Input Analyzed:
- Dataset Name
- Dataset Description
- Keywords

### Context Sources:
- Strategy and Objectives File
- Keyword-to-Expert Mapping
- Expert Roles and Capabilities
- Historical Feedback (optional)

---

## ⚙️ Routing Logic

1. Extract and interpret the domain and intent from the input.
2. Match relevant domains to expert areas using:
   - Keyword patterns
   - Semantic similarity (NLP)
   - Rule-based logic tied to strategy
3. Select the minimum viable set of experts necessary to produce a high-quality, context-aware response.

## 📌 Example Routing Scenarios

| Input Theme                        | Routed To                                      |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| "solar irradiance + performance"  | Resource Expert, Forecasting Expert            |
| "grid congestion analysis"        | Grid Reliability Expert, Smart Grid Expert     |
| "maintenance cost optimization"   | O&M Expert, Financial Feasibility Expert       |
| "carbon impact of PV"             | Sustainability Expert, Resource Expert         |
| "stakeholder data sharing"        | Collaboration Expert, Regulatory Expert        |

## 🔁 Fallback and Multi-Expert Routing

- If the dataset is ambiguous, the router may:
  - Route to a broader set of experts
  - Include the Collaboration Expert by default
  - Request clarification from the user (optional)

---

## 🔐 Constraints

- The router only considers experts defined in the system.
- Routing must align with the organization’s strategy and scope.
- It does not activate experts for inputs outside strategic relevance.

---

## 📦 Output

The router returns:
- A list of expert identifiers selected for activation
- A rationale or confidence score (optional)
