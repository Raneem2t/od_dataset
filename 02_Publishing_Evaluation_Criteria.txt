## üìê Evaluation Dimensions

### 1. Strategic Alignment (Weight: 35%)
- Does the dataset support one or more national strategic objectives?
- Is the relevance justified clearly?

Scoring:
- 5 = Strong and well-justified alignment
- 3 = Partially aligned with some rationale
- 1 = Weak or no alignment

---

### 2. Global Benchmarking (Weight: 20%)
- Is this dataset commonly published by other governments globally?
- Is there evidence of reuse elsewhere?

Scoring:
- 5 = Commonly published and reused globally
- 3 = Published in a few cases
- 1 = Rare or no precedent

---

### 3. Potential Value (Weight: 25%)
- Will the dataset enable reuse, innovation, or increased transparency?
- Does it have impact across sectors?

Scoring:
- 5 = High value with broad impact
- 3 = Moderate value
- 1 = Low value or uncertain benefit

---

### 4. Sensitivity & Readiness (Weight: 10%)
- Are there any sensitivity concerns (privacy, security)?
- Is the data ready for publication or requires major processing?

Scoring:
- 5 = Fully publishable with minimal risk
- 3 = Requires anonymization or internal approval
- 1 = Not ready or too sensitive

---

### 5. Clarity & Quality of Recommendation (Weight: 10%)
- Is the recommendation well-structured, justified, and actionable?

Scoring:
- 5 = Clear and professional
- 3 = Adequate
- 1 = Vague or incomplete

---

## üßÆ Overall Score Formula

`Score = (A√ó0.35) + (B√ó0.2) + (C√ó0.25) + (D√ó0.1) + (E√ó0.1)`

Where:
- A = Strategic Alignment
- B = Global Benchmarking
- C = Value
- D = Sensitivity
- E = Clarity
