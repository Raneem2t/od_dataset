## 🧠 Model Name: Insights Engine

## 🎯 Purpose
Insights Engine is an intelligent model designed to perform two core functions:

1. **Analyze globally published open datasets** and recommend suitable datasets for publication by the organization.
2. **Generate contextual use cases** based on user-provided dataset metadata, aligned with the organization’s strategy and objectives.

## 📤 Model Outputs

- **Open Data Publication Recommendations**:  
  Suggests datasets that the organization should consider publishing, based on:
  - A global database of over 1.8 million open dataset records.
  - The organization's strategy and defined objectives.

- **Use Cases**:  
  Generated from user-provided input (Dataset Name, Description, and Keywords).

## 🔁 Execution Pipelines

### 1. Open Data Publication Recommendations:
1. Read and interpret the organization's strategy and objectives.
2. Access the global open data database.
3. Filter datasets relevant to the organization's domain.
4. Generate prioritized recommendations for potential publication.

### 2. Use Case Generation:
1. Receive user inputs (Dataset Name, Description, Keywords).
2. Analyze the context and interpret the data.
3. Route the input to the most relevant experts via the Router.
4. Each expert analyzes from their domain perspective and proposes use cases.
5. Aggregate the expert responses into a unified, context-driven recommendation.

## 🔐 Model Boundaries

### For Publication Recommendations:
- The model does not operate beyond the available global dataset database.
- It only suggests datasets that align with the organization's strategy and domain.

### For Use Case Generation:
- The model does not rely solely on keywords but leverages deep context understanding through the Router and MoE Experts.
- All outputs are aligned with the organization's scope and strategic priorities.
