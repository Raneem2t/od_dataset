## 🔁 Router Workflow & Logic

This file describes how the Insights Engine's Router functions to manage and direct input data to the most appropriate expert(s).

---

## 🔧 Router Responsibilities

- Analyze incoming dataset metadata (name, description, keywords).
- Match metadata against classification rules and keyword mappings.
- Select the most relevant expert(s) to handle the use case generation.
- Route input to 1–3 experts maximum to ensure focus and relevance.
- Prevent redundant evaluations by inappropriate experts.

## ⚙️ Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Metadata Preprocessing
- Normalize text (lowercase, strip symbols).
- Translate non-English keywords if needed.
- Remove duplicates and general terms.

### Step 2: Keyword Matching
- Match keywords against `06_Domain_Keyword_Mapping.json`.
- Score keyword-expert associations based on frequency and relevance.
- Apply weight to contextual clues in description if keywords are ambiguous.

### Step 3: Classification Rule Application
- Use `07_Dataset_Classification_Rules.txt` to assign a domain label.
- Use this domain label to prioritize specific expert roles.

### Step 4: Expert Ranking & Selection
- Combine scores from keyword and classification steps.
- Select the top-ranked experts (usually 1 or 2; max 3).
- Ensure diversity (e.g., don’t select 3 similar experts if others add value).

### Step 5: Routing Decision
- Route to selected experts only.
- Log routing decisions for traceability.

## 🤖 Example Routing Logic

Input:
- Dataset: “Wind Speed Observations – Red Sea Offshore”
- Keywords: [“wind”, “offshore”, “turbine”, “forecast”]
- Description includes “high-resolution wind resource assessment for offshore planning.”

Routing Result:
- Experts:
  - Resource Expert
  - Forecasting Expert

## 🧩 Edge Case Handling

- If no strong match found → Default route to Collaboration Expert.
- If conflict between rules and keywords → Favor rule-based domain.
- If expert capacity is full (in live model) → Queue input or reroute with delay.

## 📌 Notes

- The router operates independently of expert content logic.
- Router decisions are explainable and auditable.
- Future versions may incorporate LLM-based routing for contextual nuance.
