    "description": "The datasets comprise greenhouse gas (GHG) emission factors (Factors) for 1,016 U.S. commodities as defined by the 2017 version of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The Factors are based on GHG data for 2022. Factors are given for all NAICS-defined commodities at the 6-digit level except for electricity, government, and households. Each record consists of three factor types as in the previous releases: Supply Chain Emissions without Margins (SEF), Margins of Supply Chain Emissions (MEF), and Supply Chain Emissions with Margins (SEF+MEF). One set of Factors provides kg carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) per 2022 U.S. dollar (USD) for all GHGs combined using 100-yr global warming potentials from IPCC 5th report (AR5) to calculate the equivalents. In this dataset there is one SEF, MEF and SEF+MEF per commodity. The other dataset of Factors provides kg of each unique GHG emitted per 2022 dollar per commodity without the CO2e calculation. The dollar in the denominator of all factors uses purchaser prices. See the supporting file 'Aboutv1.3SupplyChainGHGEmissionFactors.docx' for complete documentation of this dataset. ",

COVID-NET, along with the Respiratory Syncytial Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RSV-NET) and the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET), comprise the Respiratory Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RESP-NET). The RESP-NET platforms have overlapping surveillance areas and use similar methods to collect data. COVID-NET is CDC’s source for important data on rates of hospitalizations associated with COVID-19. Hospitalization rates show how many people in the surveillance area are hospitalized with COVID-19, compared to the total number of people residing in that area.\n\nData are preliminary and subject to change as more data become available. Data will be updated weekly.",

    "description": "***Starting on March 7th, 2024, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) will adopt a new Records Management System for reporting crimes and arrests. This new system is being implemented to comply with the FBI's mandate to collect NIBRS-only data (NIBRS — FBI - https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/more-fbi-services-and-information/ucr/nibrs).\nDuring this transition, users will temporarily see only incidents reported in the retiring system. However, the LAPD is actively working on generating new NIBRS datasets to ensure a smoother and more efficient reporting system. ***\n\n******Update 1/18/2024 - LAPD is facing issues with posting the Crime data, but we are taking immediate action to resolve the problem. We understand the importance of providing reliable and up-to-date information and are committed to delivering it.\n\nAs we work through the issues, we have temporarily reduced our updates from weekly to bi-weekly to ensure that we provide accurate information. Our team is actively working to identify and resolve these issues promptly.\n\nWe apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding. Rest assured, we are doing everything we can to fix the problem and get back to providing weekly updates as soon as possible. ****** \n\n\nThis dataset reflects incidents of crime in the City of Los Angeles dating back to 2020. This data is transcribed from original crime reports that are typed on paper and therefore there may be some inaccuracies within the data. Some location fields with missing data are noted as (0°, 0°). Address fields are only provided to the nearest hundred block in order to maintain privacy. This data is as accurate as the data in the database. Please note questions or concerns in the comments.",

The Factors are based on GHG data representing 2019. Factors are given for all NAICS-defined commodities at the 6-digit level except for electricity, government, and households. Each record consists of three factor types as in the previous releases: Supply Chain Emissions without Margins (SEF), Margins of Supply Chain Emissions (MEF), and Supply Chain Emissions with Margins (SEF+MEF). One set of Factors (SupplyChainGHGEmissionFactors_v1.2_NAICS_CO2e_USD2021.csv) provides kg carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) per USD for all GHGs combined using 100 yr global warming potentials from the 4th IPPC Assessment report to calculate the equivalents. In this dataset there is one SEF, MEF and SEF+MEF per commodity. The other dataset of Factors (SupplyChainGHGEmissionFactors_v1.2_NAICS_byGHG_USD2021.csv) provides kg of each unique GHG emitted per dollar per commodity without the CO2e calculation. The dollar (USD) in the denominator of all factors uses purchaser prices in 2021 USD.  See the supporting file 'Aboutthe2019v1.2SupplyChainGHGEmissionFactors.pdf' for complete documentation of this dataset.",

    "title": "Provisional COVID-19 death counts, rates, and percent of total deaths, by jurisdiction of residence",
    "description": "This file contains COVID-19 death counts, death rates, and percent of total deaths by jurisdiction of residence. The data is grouped by different time periods including 3-month period, weekly, and total (cumulative since January 1, 2020). United States death counts and rates include the 50 states, plus the District of Columbia and New York City. New York state estimates exclude New York City. Puerto Rico is included in HHS Region 2 estimates.\n\nDeaths with confirmed or presumed COVID-19, coded to ICD–10 code U07.1. Number of deaths reported in this file are the total number of COVID-19 deaths received and coded as of the date of analysis and may not represent all deaths that occurred in that period. Counts of deaths occurring before or after the reporting period are not included in the file.\n\nData during recent periods are incomplete because of the lag in time between when the death occurred and when the death certificate is completed, submitted to NCHS and processed for reporting purposes. This delay can range from 1 week to 8 weeks or more, depending on the jurisdiction and cause of death.\n\nDeath counts should not be compared across states. Data timeliness varies by state. Some states report deaths on a daily basis, while other states report deaths weekly or monthly. \n\nThe ten (10) United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regions include the following jurisdictions. Region 1: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont; Region 2: New Jersey, New York, New York City, Puerto Rico; Region 3: Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia; Region 4: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee; Region 5: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Wisconsin; Region 6: Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas; Region 7: Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska; Region 8: Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Wyoming; Region 9: Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada; Region 10: Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, Washington.\n\nRates were calculated using the population estimates for 2021, which are estimated as of July 1, 2021 based on the Blended Base produced by the US Census Bureau in lieu of the April 1, 2020 decennial population count. The Blended Base consists of the blend of Vintage 2020 postcensal population estimates, 2020 Demographic Analysis Estimates, and 2020 Census PL 94-171 Redistricting File (see https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/methodology/2020-2021/methods-statement-v2021.pdf).\n\nRates are based on deaths occurring in the specified week/month and are age-adjusted to the 2000 standard population using the direct method (see https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr70/nvsr70-08-508.pdf). These rates differ from annual age-adjusted rates, typically presented in NCHS publications based on a full year of data and annualized weekly/monthly age-adjusted rates which have been adjusted to allow comparison with annual rates.  Annualization rates presents deaths per year per 100,000 population that would be expected in a year if the observed period specific (weekly/monthly) rate prevailed for a full year.\n\nSub-national death counts between 1-9 are suppressed in accordance with NCHS data confidentiality standards. Rates based on death counts less than 20 are suppressed in accordance with NCHS standards of reliability as specified in NCHS Data Presentation Standards for Proportions (available from: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_02/sr02_175.pdf.).",

    "description": "The International Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) produces regular Assessment Reports that provide global warming potentials (GWPs) for greenhouse gases (GHG) in the context of multiple time horizons including 20, 100, and 500 years. The GWPs (in kg CO2-equivalent per kg GHG) can be multiplied by kg GHGs emitted for use in estimating CO2-equivalent (CO2e) impacts of GHGs emitted. In the context of life cycle assessment (LCA) , the GWPs can be used as characterization factors in of the life cycle impact assessment. This dataset provides 20- (GWP-20), 100- (GWP-100) and 500-year (GWP-500) GWPs from the 4th (AR4), 6th (AR6) IPCC assessment reports, and 20- (GWP-20) and 100-year (GWP-100) GWPs from the 5th (AR5) report (AR5 provided no 500 yr GWPs). Datasets are provided in simple tables in Excel, in the openLCA JSON-LD format compliant with the U.S. Federal LCA Commons standards, and in Apache parquet format for the most efficient import into applications or scripts using languages like Python and R. The names for GHGs are from the Federal LCA Elementary Flow List (FEDEFL) v1.2, which are names preferred for this GHGs in the USEPA's Substance Registry Service. These datasets were created using the LCIA Formatter v1.1.1 (https://github.com/USEPA/LCIAformatter).  The GWP values are provided in these formats for convenient use; the values have not been altered from the values reported in the Assessment Reports. \nPython code used to produce the data is available in a github gist under the supporting data links along with dataset metadata from the LCIA formatter.\n",

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.\n\nZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) are approximate area representations of U.S. Postal Service (USPS) ZIP Code service areas that the Census Bureau creates to present statistical data for each decennial census. The Census Bureau delineates ZCTA boundaries for the United States, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands once each decade following the decennial census. Data users should not use ZCTAs to identify the official USPS ZIP Code for mail delivery. The USPS makes periodic changes to ZIP Codes to support more efficient mail delivery.\n\nThe Census Bureau uses tabulation blocks as the basis for defining each ZCTA. Tabulation blocks are assigned to a ZCTA based on the most frequently occurring ZIP Code for the addresses contained within that block. The most frequently occurring ZIP Code also becomes the five-digit numeric code of the ZCTA. These codes may contain leading zeros.\n\nBlocks that do not contain addresses but are surrounded by a single ZCTA (enclaves) are assigned to the surrounding ZCTA. Because the Census Bureau only uses the most frequently occurring ZIP Code to assign blocks, a ZCTA may not exist for every USPS ZIP Code. Some ZIP Codes may not have a matching ZCTA because too few addresses were associated with the specific ZIP Code or the ZIP Code was not the most frequently occurring ZIP Code within any of the blocks where it exists.\n\nThe ZCTA boundaries in this release are those delineated following the 2020 Census.",

The earliest data dates vary considerably by state and region: Maine, Pennsylvania, and Texas have data since 1900. The western Pacific region that includes Guam, American Samoa, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau have data since 1978. Other states and regions have earliest dates between those extremes. The latest data in all states and regions is from the present day. The major parameter in DSI-3240 is precipitation amounts, which are measurements of hourly or daily precipitation accumulation. Accumulation was for longer periods of time if for any reason the rain gauge was out of service or no observer was present. DSI 3240_01 contains data grouped by state; DSI 3240_02 contains data grouped by year.",

    "title": "Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes",
    "description": "The Motor Vehicle Collisions crash table contains details on the crash event. Each row represents a crash event. The Motor Vehicle Collisions data tables contain information from all police reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC. The police report (MV104-AN) is required to be filled out for collisions where someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage (https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/ny_overlay_mv-104an_rev05_2004.pdf).  It should be noted that the data is preliminary and subject to change when the MV-104AN forms are amended based on revised crash details.For the most accurate, up to date statistics on traffic fatalities, please refer to the <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/traffic-data/traffic-data-collision.page\" style=\"color:#187bcd;\">NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions page</a> (updated weekly) or <a href=\"http://www.nycvzv.info/\" style=\"color:#187bcd;\">Vision Zero View</a> (updated monthly).\r\n\r\n</p>\r\nDue to success of the CompStat program, NYPD began to ask how to apply the CompStat principles  to other problems.  Other than homicides, the fatal incidents with which police have the most contact with the public are fatal traffic collisions.  Therefore in April 1998, the Department implemented TrafficStat, which uses the CompStat model to work towards improving traffic safety.  Police officers complete form MV-104AN  for all vehicle collisions.  The MV-104AN is a New York State form that has all of the details of a traffic collision.  Before implementing Trafficstat, there was no uniform traffic safety data collection procedure for all of the NYPD precincts.  Therefore, the Police Department implemented the Traffic Accident Management System (TAMS) in July 1999 in order to collect traffic data in a uniform method across the City.  TAMS required the precincts manually enter a few selected MV-104AN fields to collect very basic intersection traffic crash statistics which included the number of accidents, injuries and fatalities. As the years progressed, there grew a need for additional traffic data so that more detailed analyses could be conducted. The Citywide traffic safety initiative, Vision Zero started in the year 2014.  Vision Zero further emphasized the need for the collection of more traffic data in order to work towards the Vision Zero goal, which is to eliminate traffic fatalities.  Therefore, the Department in March 2016 replaced the TAMS with the new Finest Online Records Management System (FORMS).  FORMS enables the police officers to electronically, using a Department cellphone or computer, enter all of the MV-104AN data fields and stores all of the MV-104AN data fields in the Department’s crime data warehouse.  Since all of the MV-104AN data fields are now stored for each traffic collision, detailed traffic safety analyses can be conducted as applicable.",

The dataset depicts the authoritative locations of the most commonly known Department of Defense (DoD) sites, installations, ranges, and training areas world-wide. These sites encompass land which is federally owned or otherwise managed. This dataset was created from source data provided by the four Military Service Component headquarters and was compiled by the Defense Installation Spatial Data Infrastructure (DISDI) Program within the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations, and Environment. Only sites reported in the BSR or released in a map supplementing the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 (FIRRMA) Real Estate Regulation (31 CFR Part 802) were considered for inclusion. This list does not necessarily represent a comprehensive collection of all Department of Defense facilities. For inventory purposes, installations are comprised of sites, where a site is defined as a specific geographic location of federally owned or managed land and is assigned to military installation. DoD installations are commonly referred to as a base, camp, post, station, yard, center, homeport facility for any ship, or other activity under the jurisdiction, custody, control of the DoD.\n\nWhile every attempt has been made to provide the best available data quality, this data set is intended for use at mapping scales between 1:50,000 and 1:3,000,000. For this reason, boundaries in this data set may not perfectly align with DoD site boundaries depicted in other federal data sources. Maps produced at a scale of 1:50,000 or smaller which otherwise comply with National Map Accuracy Standards, will remain compliant when this data is incorporated. Boundary data is most suitable for larger scale maps; point locations are better suited for mapping scales between 1:250,000 and 1:3,000,000.\n\nIf a site is part of a Joint Base (effective/designated on 1 October, 2010) as established under the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure process, it is attributed with the name of the Joint Base. All sites comprising a Joint Base are also attributed to the responsible DoD Component, which is not necessarily the pre-2005 Component responsible for the site.",

Walkability depends upon characteristics of the built environment that influence the likelihood of walking being used as a mode of travel. The Walkability Index is based on the EPA's previous data product, the Smart Location Database (SLD). Block group data from the SLD was the only input into the Walkability Index, and consisted of four variables from the SLD weighted in a formula to create the new Walkability Index. This dataset shares the SLD's block group boundary definitions from Census 2019. The methodology describing the process of creating the Walkability Index can be found in the documents located at https://edg.epa.gov/EPADataCommons/public/OA/WalkabilityIndex.zip. You can also learn more about the Smart Location Database at https://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/smart-location-mapping.",

    "description": "This web map displays data from the voter registration database as the percent of registered voters by census tract in King County, Washington.\n\nThe data for this web map is compiled from King County Elections voter registration data for the years 2013-2019. The total number of registered voters is based on the geo-location of the voter's registered address at the time of the general election for each year. The eligible voting population, age 18 and over, is based on the estimated population increase from the US Census Bureau and the Washington Office of Financial Management and was calculated as a projected 6 percent population increase for the years 2010-2013, 7 percent population increase for the years 2010-2014, 9 percent population increase for the years 2010-2015, 11 percent population increase for the years 2010-2016 & 2017, 14 percent population increase for the years 2010-2018 and 17 percent population increase for the years 2010-2019. The total population 18 and over in 2010 was 1,517,747 in King County, Washington. The percentage of registered voters represents the number of people who are registered to vote as compared to the eligible voting population, age 18 and over. \n\nThe voter registration data by census tract was grouped into six percentage range estimates: 50% or below, 51-60%, 61-70%, 71-80%, 81-90% and 91% or above with an overall 84 percent registration rate. In the map the lighter colors represent a relatively low percentage range of voter registration and the darker colors represent a relatively high percentage range of voter registration. PDF maps of these data can be viewed at King County Elections downloadable voter registration maps. \n\nThe 2019 General Election Voter Turnout layer is voter turnout data by historical precinct boundaries for the corresponding year. The data is grouped into six percentage ranges: 0-30%, 31-40%, 41-50% 51-60%, 61-70%, and 71-100%. The lighter colors represent lower turnout and the darker colors represent higher turnout.\n\nThe King County Demographics Layer is census data for language, income, poverty, race and ethnicity at the census tract level and is based on the 2010-2014 American Community Survey 5 year Average provided by the United States Census Bureau. Since the data is based on a survey, they are considered to be estimates and should be used with that understanding. The demographic data sets were developed and are maintained by King County Staff to support the King County Equity and Social Justice program. Other data for this map is located in the King County GIS Spatial Data Catalog, where data is managed by the King County GIS Center, a multi-department enterprise GIS in King County, Washington.\n\nKing County has nearly 1.3 million registered voters and is the largest jurisdiction in the United States to conduct all elections by mail. In the map you can view the percent of registered voters by census tract, compare registration within political districts, compare registration and demographic data, verify your voter registration or register to vote through a link to the VoteWA, Washington State Online Voter Registration web page.",

    "description": "This is a tiled collection of the 3D Elevation Program (3DEP) and is one meter\nresolution. The 3DEP data holdings serve as the elevation layer of The National Map, and\nprovide foundational elevation information for earth science studies and mapping\napplications in the United States. Scientists and resource managers use 3DEP data for\nhydrologic modeling, resource monitoring, mapping and visualization, and many other\napplications. The elevations in this DEM represent the topographic bare-earth surface. USGS\nstandard one-meter DEMs are produced exclusively from high resolution light detection and\nranging (lidar) source data of one-meter or higher resolution. One-meter DEM surfaces are\nseamless within collection projects, but, not necessarily seamless across projects. The\nspatial reference used for tiles of the one-meter DEM within the conterminous United States\n(CONUS) is Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) in units of meters, and in conformance with\nthe North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). All bare earth elevation values are in meters and\nare referenced to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88). Each tile is\ndistributed in the UTM Zone in which it lies. If a tile crosses two UTM zones, it is\ndelivered in both zones. The one-meter DEM is the highest resolution standard DEM offered in\nthe 3DEP product suite. Other 3DEP products are nationally seamless DEMs in resolutions of\n1/3, 1, and 2 arc seconds. These seamless DEMs were referred to as the National Elevation\nDataset (NED) from about 2000 through 2015 at which time they became the seamless DEM layers\nunder the 3DEP program and the NED name and system were retired. Other 3DEP products include\nfive-meter DEMs in Alaska as well as various source datasets including the lidar point cloud\nand interferometric synthetic aperture radar (Ifsar) digital surface models and intensity\nimages. All 3DEP products are public domain.",

    "description": "The 119th Congressional Districts dataset reflects boundaries from January 03, 2025 from the United States Census Bureau (USCB), and the attributes are updated every Sunday from the United States House of Representatives and is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT)/Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) National Transportation Atlas Database (NTAD). The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Information for each member of Congress is appended to the Census Congressional District shapefile using information from the Office of the Clerk, U.S. House of Representatives' website https://clerk.house.gov/xml/lists/MemberData.xml and its corresponding XML file. Congressional districts are the 435 areas from which people are elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. This dataset also includes 9 geographies for non-voting at large delegate districts, resident commissioner districts, and congressional districts that are not defined. After the apportionment of congressional seats among the states based on census population counts, each state is responsible for establishing congressional districts for the purpose of electing representatives. Each congressional district is to be as equal in population to all other congressional districts in a state as practicable. The 119th Congress is seated from January 3, 2025 through January 3, 2027. In Connecticut, Illinois, and New Hampshire, the Redistricting Data Program (RDP) participant did not define the CDs to cover all of the state or state equivalent area. In these areas with no CDs defined, the code \"ZZ\" has been assigned, which is treated as a single CD for purposes of data presentation. The TIGER/Line shapefiles for the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas (American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) each contain a single record for the non-voting delegate district in these areas. The boundaries of all other congressional districts reflect information provided to the Census Bureau by the states by May 31, 2024.

    "description": "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides air pollution data about ozone and particulate matter (PM2.5) to CDC for the Tracking Network. The EPA maintains a database called the Air Quality System (AQS) which contains data from approximately 4,000 monitoring stations around the country, mainly in urban areas. Data from the AQS is considered the \"gold standard\" for determining outdoor air pollution. However, AQS data are limited because the monitoring stations are usually in urban areas or cities and because they only take air samples for some air pollutants every three days or during times of the year when air pollution is very high. CDC and EPA have worked together to develop a statistical model (Downscaler) to make modeled predictions available for environmental public health tracking purposes in areas of the country that do not have monitors and to fill in the time gaps when monitors may not be recording data. This data does not include \"Percent of population in counties exceeding NAAQS (vs. population in counties that either meet the standard or do not monitor PM2.5)\". Please visit the Tracking homepage for this information.View additional information for indicator definitions and documentation by selecting Content Area \"Air Quality\" and the respective indicator at the following website: http://ephtracking.cdc.gov/showIndicatorsData.action",

The images are orthorectified which combines the image characteristics of an aerial photograph with the georeferenced qualities of a map. In 2018, the ground resolution standard changed to 0.6 meter with the option for 0.3 meter data was added for consideration over coastal states. The repeat flying cycle was also changed to no longer than a 3-year cycle from its 5-year cycle back in 2003-2009. 2009 to present coverage provides a refresh of every 3-years and less responding to user needs across the United States. Each individual image tile is based on a 3.75-minute longitude by 3.75-minute latitude quarter quadrangle plus a 300-meter buffer on all four sides. In 2024 the buffer was changed to 12-meters on all four sides. Tiles in the NAIP collection are natural color (red, green, and blue bands) or color near infra-red (red, green, blue, and near infrared bands) and may contain as much as 10 percent cloud cover per tile.",

    "title": "Supply Chain Greenhouse Gas Emission Factors for US Industries and Commodities",
    "description": "Many organizations quantify greenhouse emissions in their value chain. Emissions from purchased goods and services and capital goods, referred to as Scope 3 emissions in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Scope 3 Accounting and Reporting Standard, represent a significant emissions source for many organizations. To assist in quantifying these emissions, we have developed a comprehensive set of supply chain emission factors covering all categories of goods and services in the US economy. These factors are intended for quantifying emissions from purchased goods and services using the spend-based method defined in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions. The factors were prepared using USEEIO models, which are a life cycle models of goods and services in the US economy.\n\nThe supply chain emission factors are presented in units of kilogram emissions per US dollar of purchases for a category of goods and services with a defined life cycle scope. Sets of factors covering all sectors of the economy are provided for years from 2010 to 2016 with two levels of sector aggregation. The factors are provided for both industries and commodities, where commodities are equivalent to a category of good or service, and industries are producers of one or more commodities. A set of five data quality scores covering data reliability, temporal, geographical and technological correlation and completeness of data collection is provided along with each factor.\n\nThe factors presented are as follows:\n1. Supply Chain Emission Factors without Margins: emissions associated with cradle to factory gate\n2. Margins of Supply Chain Emission Factors: emissions associated with factory gate to shelf, which includes emissions from transportation, wholesale and retail as well as adjustments for price markups\n3. Supply Chain Emission Factors with Margins: emissions associated with cradle to shelf (equal to the sum of the above two factors)\n\nEnd users of products will likely find the Supply Chain Emission Factors with Margins most appropriate for their use. Organizations purchasing intermediate products at the factory gate will likely find the Supply Chain Emission Factors without Margins to be most appropriate.\n\nSee the Executive Summary of the associated report for an example calculation using the factors.\n\nAll factors are associated with limitations and variations in underlying data quality. We encourage the reader to carefully read the report to understand the differences across these sets, underlying assumptions in their calculation, their limitations to decide if they are appropriate for their intended use. If the reader deems the factors are appropriate, this report along with the factor data quality scores will aid in selection of factors best fit for their intended use. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nIngwersen, W., and M. Li. Supply Chain Greenhouse Gas Emission Factors for US Industries and Commodities. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, DC, USA, 2020.",

The Household Pulse Survey was designed to gauge the impact of the pandemic on employment status, consumer spending, food security, housing, education disruptions, and dimensions of physical and mental wellness.\n\nThe survey was designed to meet the goal of accurate and timely weekly estimates. It was conducted by an internet questionnaire, with invitations to participate sent by email and text message. The sample frame is the Census Bureau Master Address File Data. Housing units linked to one or more email addresses or cell phone numbers were randomly selected to participate, and one respondent from each housing unit was selected to respond for him or herself. Estimates are weighted to adjust for nonresponse and to match Census Bureau estimates of the population by age, gender, race and ethnicity, and educational attainment. All estimates shown meet the NCHS Data Presentation Standards for Proportions.",

    "description": "The Global Historical Climatology Network - Daily (GHCN-Daily/GHCNd) dataset integrates daily climate observations from approximately 30 different data sources. Version 3 was released in September 2012 with the addition of data from two additional station networks. Changes to the processing system associated with the version 3 release also allowed for updates to occur 7 days a week rather than only on most weekdays. Version 3 contains station-based measurements from well over 90,000 land-based stations worldwide, about two thirds of which are for precipitation measurement only. Other meteorological elements include, but are not limited to, daily maximum and minimum temperature, temperature at the time of observation, snowfall and snow depth. Over 25,000 stations are regularly updated with observations from within roughly the last month. The dataset is also routinely reconstructed (usually every week) from its roughly 30 data sources to ensure that GHCNd is generally in sync with its growing list of constituent sources. During this process, quality assurance checks are applied to the full dataset. Where possible, GHCNd station data are also updated daily from a variety of data streams. Station values for each daily update also undergo a suite of quality checks.",

    "description": "This dataset consists of various USEEIO v2.5 models.\nAll models are built using the coupled model approach described in the EPA 2024 report \"Estimating embodied environmental flows in international imports for the U.S. Environmentally-Extended Input-Output (USEEIO) Model\" and using the v1.7.0 release of useeior.\nModels are named using an alias that corresponds with a unique set of model attributes, and the final two digits represent the last two digits of the year intended to be represented. Model alias attributes are defined at https://github.com/USEPA/USEEIO/blob/master/models.md#aliases.\nCatbird and oriole are detailed and summary-level models, respectively, coupled with CEDA 2024 for representing GHGs in imports.\nKinglet and kingbird are detailed and summary-level models, respectively, coupled with EXIOBASE v3.8.2 for representing GHGs in imports.\nWaxwing and yellowthroat are detailed and summary-level models, respectively, coupled with the GLORIA v59a model for representing GHGs and material flows in imports.\nThe summary level models are available for 2017-2022 for EXIOBASE- and GLORIA-coupled models and 2022 for the CEDA-coupled model. The detailed CEDA, EXIOBASE and GLORIA coupled models are only available for 2022 (note underlying U.S. IO data represents 2017 for detailed models). \n\n\"v2.5-kingbird-\" models replace \"v2.3-s-GHG-\" models, published under \"USEEIO Models with Import Emission Factors for Greenhouse Gases for 2017-2022 from EXIOBASE coupled model\".\n\"v2.5-oriole-22\" replaces \"v2.4-oriole-22\" , published under \"USEEIO Models with Import Emission Factors for Greenhouse Gases for 2022 from CEDA coupled model\". \n\nThe model objects are in unique tabs/worksheets of each file and defined in https://github.com/USEPA/useeior/blob/v1.7.0/format_specs/Model.md.\nLinks to the model specification files are provided below. \n\nMore information can be found on these models in two additions to the original EPA report \"Estimating embodied environmental flows in international imports for the USEEIO Model\" https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_report.cfm?dirEntryId=362470. The \"Corrigendum: Updated Results for Consumption-based GHG Emissions\" describes updates related to the EXIOBASE and CEDA coupled models. Addendum 2 describes the GLORIA coupled models. \n\nPlease cite this dataset as \"Young, Ben, and Wesley Ingwersen. 2025. USEEIO v2.5 Models.

    "description": "This dataset includes an aggregated and event-correlated analysis of power outages in the United States, synthesized by integrating three data sources: the Environment for the Analysis of Geo-Located Energy Information (EAGLE-I), the Electric Emergency Incident Disturbance Report (DOE-417), and Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for Counties 2024 (CO-EST2024-POP). The EAGLE-I dataset, spanning from 2014 to 2023, encompasses over 146 million customers and offers county-level outage information at 15-minute intervals. The data has been processed, filtered, and aggregated to deliver an enhanced perspective on power outages, which are then correlated with DOE-417 data based on geographic location as well as the start and end times of events. For each major disturbance documented in DOE-417, essential metrics are defined to quantify the outages associated with the event. This dataset supports researchers in examining outages triggered by major disturbances like extreme weather and physical disruptions, thereby aiding studies on power system resilience. \n\nLinks to the raw data for generating the correlated dataset are included below as \"DOE-417\", \"EAGLE-I\", and  \"CO-EST2024-POP\" resources. \n\nAcknowledgement: This work is funded by the Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) as part of the Resilience Through Data-Driven, Intelligently Designed Control (RD2C) Initiative.",

    "description": "This dataset provides the waste sector disaggregation data, model component matrices, model result matrices, model price adjustment matrices, demand vectors,  and associated metadata for the USEEIO v2.0.1-411 model. This model was generated using useeior v1.0.0 (https://github.com/USEPA/useeior/tree/v1.0.0/) by calling the buildModel() function and passing \"USEEIOv2.0.1-411\" as the model. This uses the model configuration file, which can be found @ https://github.com/USEPA/useeior/blob/v1.0.0/inst/extdata/modelspecs/USEEIOv2.0.1.yml.  The model is named according to the USEEIO model versioning scheme, https://github.com/USEPA/USEEIO/blob/8a43f7f5f847fe1ca6dadca3c433bceb3f29981b/VersioningScheme.md. The resulting model was exported using the writeModeltoXLSX() function to create this dataset. The waste disaggregation data are required for model building and also embedded in useeior. The generateModelIdentifier() function was used on the same model create the model identifier. The US dollar (USD) year for the model data, where USD is used, is 2012. See any additional notes in Contents on specific components. A complete description can be found in the associated manuscript. \n",

    "description": "NOTE: This dataset has been retired and marked as historical-only.\n\nWeekly rates of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths among people living in Chicago by vaccination status and age. \n\nRates for fully vaccinated and unvaccinated begin the week ending April 3, 2021 when COVID-19 vaccines became widely available in Chicago. Rates for boosted begin the week ending October 23, 2021 after booster shots were recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for adults 65+ years old and adults in certain populations and high risk occupational and institutional settings who received Pfizer or Moderna for their primary series or anyone who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. \n\nChicago residency is based on home address, as reported in the Illinois Comprehensive Automated Immunization Registry Exchange (I-CARE) and Illinois National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (I-NEDSS).\n\nOutcomes:\n•\tCases: People with a positive molecular (PCR) or antigen COVID-19 test result from an FDA-authorized COVID-19 test that was reported into I-NEDSS. A person can become re-infected with SARS-CoV-2 over time and so may be counted more than once in this dataset. Cases are counted by week the test specimen was collected.\n•\tHospitalizations: COVID-19 cases who are hospitalized due to a documented COVID-19 related illness or who are admitted for any reason within 14 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Hospitalizations are counted by week of hospital admission.\n•\tDeaths: COVID-19 cases who died from COVID-19-related health complications as determined by vital records or a public health investigation. Deaths are counted by week of death.\n\nVaccination status:\n•\tFully vaccinated: Completion of primary series of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine at least 14 days prior to a positive test (with no other positive tests in the previous 45 days).\n•\tBoosted: Fully vaccinated with an additional or booster dose of any FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine received at least 14 days prior to a positive test (with no other positive tests in the previous 45 days).\n•\tUnvaccinated: No evidence of having received a dose of an FDA-authorized or approved vaccine prior to a positive test. \n\nCLARIFYING NOTE: Those who started but did not complete all recommended doses of an FDA-authorized or approved vaccine prior to a positive test (i.e., partially vaccinated) are excluded from this dataset.\n\nIncidence rates for fully vaccinated but not boosted people (Vaccinated columns) are calculated as total fully vaccinated but not boosted with outcome divided by cumulative fully vaccinated but not boosted at the end of each week. Incidence rates for boosted (Boosted columns) are calculated as total boosted with outcome divided by cumulative boosted at the end of each week. Incidence rates for unvaccinated (Unvaccinated columns) are calculated as total unvaccinated with outcome divided by total population minus cumulative boosted, fully, and partially vaccinated at the end of each week. All rates are multiplied by 100,000. \n\nIncidence rate ratios (IRRs) are calculated by dividing the weekly incidence rates among unvaccinated people by those among fully vaccinated but not boosted and boosted people. \n\nOverall age-adjusted incidence rates and IRRs are standardized using the 2000 U.S. Census standard population.\n\nPopulation totals are from U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey 1-year estimates for 2019. \n\nAll data are provisional and subject to change. Information is updated as additional details are received and it is, in fact, very common for recent dates to be incomplete and to be updated as time goes on. This dataset reflects data known to CDPH at the time when the dataset is updated each week.\n\nNumbers in this dataset may differ from other public sources due to when data are reported and how City of Chicago boundaries are defined.\n\nFor all datasets related to COVID-19, see https://data.cityofchic",

As Americans have become wealthier and more ethnically diverse, the American food basket reflects a growing share of tropical products, spices, and imported gourmet products. Seasonal and climatic factors drive U.S. imports of popular types of fruits and vegetables and tropical products, such as cocoa and coffee. In addition, a growing share of U.S. imports can be attributed to intra-industry trade, whereby agricultural-processing industries based in the United States carry out certain processing steps offshore and import products at different levels of processing from their subsidiaries in foreign markets.\r\n \r\nThis data set provides import values of edible products (food and beverages) entering U.S. ports and their origin of shipment. Data are from the U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Census Bureau. Food and beverage import values are compiled by calendar year into food groups corresponding to major commodities or level of processing. At least 10 years of annual data are included, enabling users to track long-term growth patterns.",

    "description": "The Global Landslide Catalog (GLC) was developed with the goal of identifying rainfall-triggered landslide events around the world, regardless of size, impacts or location. The GLC considers all types of mass movements triggered by rainfall, which have been reported in the media, disaster databases, scientific reports, or other sources. The GLC has been compiled since 2007 at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. This is a unique data set with the ID tag “GLC” in the landslide editor.\r\n\r\nThis dataset on data.nasa.gov was a one-time export from the Global Landslide Catalog maintained separately. It is current as of March 7, 2016. The original catalog is available here: http://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmaps.nccs.nasa.gov%2Fserver%2Frest%2Fservices%2Fglobal_landslide_catalog%2Fglc_viewer_service%2FFeatureServer&source=sd\r\n\r\nTo export GLC data, you must agree to the “Terms and Conditions”. We request that anyone using the GLC cite the two sources of this database:\r\n\r\nKirschbaum, D. B., Adler, R., Hong, Y., Hill, S., & Lerner-Lam, A. (2010).

    "title": "Wind Turbine Gearbox Condition Monitoring Vibration Analysis Benchmarking Datasets",
    "description": "Wind turbine condition monitoring (CM) can potentially help the wind industry reduce turbine downtime and operation and maintenance (O&M) cost. NREL CM research has investigated various condition-monitoring techniques such as acoustic emission (AE specifically stress wave), vibration, electrical signature, lubricant and debris monitoring based on the Gearbox Reliability Collaborative dynamometer and field tests, and other test turbines and resources accessible by NREL. During the past several years, NREL CM research has shown that there are very few validation and verification efforts on commercial wind turbine CM systems. One of the reasons might be limited benchmarking datasets accessible by stakeholders. To fill this gap, NREL executed a data collection effort. The targeted users of these datasets include those investigating vibration-based wind turbine CM research, evaluating commercially available vibration-based CM systems, or testing prototyped vibration-based CM systems.\n\nNREL collected data from a healthy and a damaged gearbox of the same design tested by the GRC. Vibration data were collected by accelerometers along with high-speed shaft RPM signals during the dynamometer testing. The healthy gearbox was only tested in the dynamometer. The damaged gearbox was first tested in the dynamometer and later sent to a wind farm close to NREL for field testing. In the field test, it experienced two loss-of-oil events that damaged its internal bearings and gear elements. The gearbox was brought back to NREL and it was retested in the dynamometer with CM systems deployed under controlled loading conditions that would not cause catastrophic failure of the gearbox.\n\nThe objective of releasing these datasets to the public along with information about the real damage that occurred to the damaged gearbox is to provide the wind industry with some benchmarking datasets. These datasets will benefit research, development, validation, verification, and advancement of vibration-based wind condition-monitoring techniques.\n\nBy accessing this data you acknowledge the terms outlined in the \"License Information\" document.\n\nPlease contract Shawn Sheng (NREL) if you have any questions on the data or would like to collaborate on publications based on the datasets.",

    "description": "FEMA Disaster Declarations Summary is a summarized dataset describing all federally declared disasters. This dataset lists all official FEMA Disaster Declarations, beginning with the first disaster declaration in 1953 and features all three disaster declaration types: major disaster, emergency, and fire management assistance. The dataset includes declared recovery programs and geographic areas (county not available before 1964; Fire Management records are considered partial due to historical nature of the dataset).rnrnPlease note the unique structure of the disaster sequencing (due to a numbering system that originated in the 1950's-1970's):rn0001-1999     Major Disaster Declarationrn2000-2999     Fire Managementrn3000-3999     Emergency Declaration (Special Emergency)rn4000-              Major Disaster DeclarationrnrnFor more information on the disaster declaration process, see https://www.fema.gov/disasters and https://www.fema.gov/disasters/how-declared rnrnThis is raw, unedited data from FEMA's National Emergency Management Information System (NEMIS) and as such is subject to a small percentage of human error. The dataset is primarily composed of historical data that was manually entered into NEMIS after it launched in 1998. The financial information is derived from NEMIS and not FEMA's official financial systems.rnrnDue to differences in reporting periods, status of obligations, and how business rules are applied, this financial information may differ slightly from official publication on public websites such as www.usaspending.gov. This dataset is not intended to be used for any official federal financial reporting.rnrnA newer version of this OpenFEMA data set has been released. This older dataset version will no longer be updated and will be archived by the end of April 2020. The following page details the latest version of this data set: https://www.fema.gov/openfema-dataset-disaster-declarations-summaries-v2. CSV and JSON Files can be downloaded from the 'Full Data' section.rnrnTo access the dataset through an API endpoint, visit the 'API Endpoint' section of the above page. Accessing data in this fashion permits data filtering, sorting, and field selection. The OpenFEMA API Documentation page provides information on API usage. rnrnIf you have media inquiries about this dataset please email the FEMA News Desk FEMA-News-Desk@dhs.gov or call (202) 646-3272.

The Household Pulse Survey was designed to gauge the impact of the pandemic on employment status, consumer spending, food security, housing, education disruptions, and dimensions of physical and mental wellness.\n\nThe survey was designed to meet the goal of accurate and timely weekly estimates. It was conducted by an internet questionnaire, with invitations to participate sent by email and text message. The sample frame is the Census Bureau Master Address File Data. Housing units linked to one or more email addresses or cell phone numbers were randomly selected to participate, and one respondent from each housing unit was selected to respond for him or herself. Estimates are weighted to adjust for nonresponse and to match Census Bureau estimates of the population by age, sex, race and ethnicity, and educational attainment.

Age-adjusted death rates (per 100,000 population) are based on the 2000 U.S. standard population. Populations used for computing death rates after 2010 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2010.

    "title": "Large Scale International Boundaries",
    "description": "Overview\n\nThe Office of the Geographer and Global Issues at the U.S. Department of State produces the Large Scale International Boundaries (LSIB) dataset.  The current edition is version 11.4 (published 24 February 2025).  The 11.4 release contains updated boundary lines and data refinements designed to extend the functionality of the dataset.  These data and generalized derivatives are the only international boundary lines approved for U.S. Government use.  The contents of this dataset reflect U.S. Government policy on international boundary alignment, political recognition, and dispute status.  They do not necessarily reflect de facto limits of control.\n\nNational Geospatial Data Asset \n\nThis dataset is a National Geospatial Data Asset (NGDAID 194) managed by the Department of State.  It is a part of the International Boundaries Theme created by the Federal Geographic Data Committee.\n            \nDataset Source Details \n\nSources for these data include treaties, relevant maps, and data from boundary commissions, as well as national mapping agencies.  Where available and applicable, the dataset incorporates information from courts, tribunals, and international arbitrations.  The research and recovery process includes analysis of satellite imagery and elevation data.  Due to the limitations of source materials and processing techniques, most lines are within 100 meters of their true position on the ground.\n\nCartographic Visualization\n\nThe LSIB is a geospatial dataset that, when used for cartographic purposes, requires additional styling. The LSIB download package contains example style files for commonly used software applications.  The attribute table also contains embedded information to guide the cartographic representation.  Additional discussion of these considerations can be found in the Use of Core Attributes in Cartographic Visualization section below.  \n\nAdditional cartographic information pertaining to the depiction and description of international boundaries or areas of special sovereignty can be found in Guidance Bulletins published by the Office of the Geographer and Global Issues:  https://data.geodata.state.gov/guidance/index.html\n\nContact\n\nDirect inquiries to internationalboundaries@state.gov.\nDirect download: https://data.geodata.state.gov/LSIB.zip\n\nAttribute Structure\n\nThe dataset uses the following attributes divided into two categories:\nATTRIBUTE NAME | ATTRIBUTE STATUS \nCC1 | Core\nCC1_GENC3 | Extension\nCC1_WPID | Extension\nCOUNTRY1 | Core\nCC2 | Core\nCC2_GENC3 | Extension\nCC2_WPID | Extension\nCOUNTRY2 | Core\nRANK | Core\nLABEL | Core\nSTATUS | Core\nNOTES | Core\nLSIB_ID | Extension\nANTECIDS | Extension\nPREVIDS | Extension\nPARENTID | Extension\nPARENTSEG | Extension\n\nThese attributes have external data sources that update separately from the LSIB:\nATTRIBUTE NAME | ATTRIBUTE STATUS \nCC1 | GENC\nCC1_GENC3 | GENC\nCC1_WPID | World Polygons\nCOUNTRY1 | DoS Lists\nCC2 | GENC\nCC2_GENC3 | GENC\nCC2_WPID | World Polygons\nCOUNTRY2 | DoS Lists\nLSIB_ID | BASE\nANTECIDS | BASE\nPREVIDS | BASE\nPARENTID | BASE\nPARENTSEG | BASE\n\nThe core attributes listed above describe the boundary lines contained within the LSIB dataset.  Removal of core attributes from the dataset will change the meaning of the lines.  An attribute status of “Extension” represents a field containing data interoperability information.  Other attributes not listed above include “FID”, “Shape_length” and “Shape.” These are components of the shapefile format and do not form an intrinsic part of the LSIB. \n\nCore Attributes\n\nThe eight core attributes listed above contain unique information which, when combined with the line geometry, comprise the LSIB dataset.  These Core Attributes are further divided into Country Code and Name Fields and Descriptive Fields. \n\nCounty Code and Country Name Fields \n\n“CC1” and “CC2” fields are machine readable fields that contain political entity codes.  These are two-character codes derived from the Geopolitical Entities, Names, and Codes Standard (GENC), Edition 3 Update 18.  “CC1_GENC3” and “CC2_GENC3” fields contain the corresponding three-character GENC codes and are extension attributes discussed below.  The codes “Q2” or “QX2” denote a line in the LSIB representing a boundary associated with areas not contained within the GENC standard.\n\nThe “COUNTRY1” and “COUNTRY2” fields contain the names of corresponding political entities.  These fields contain names approved by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names (BGN) as incorporated in the ‘\"Independent States in the World\" and \"Dependencies and Areas of Special Sovereignty\" lists maintained by the Department of State.  To ensure maximum compatibility, names are presented without diacritics and certain names are rendered using common cartographic abbreviations.  Names for lines associated with the code \"Q2\" are descriptive and not necessarily BGN-approved. Names rendered in all CAPITAL LETTERS denote independent states.   Names rendered in normal text represent dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, or are otherwise presented for the convenience of the user.\n\nDescriptive Fields\n\nThe following text fields are a part of the core attributes of the LSIB dataset and do not update from external sources. They provide additional information about each of the lines and are as follows:\nATTRIBUTE NAME | CONTAINS NULLS\nRANK | No\nSTATUS | No \nLABEL | Yes\nNOTES | Yes\n\nNeither the \"RANK\" nor \"STATUS\" fields contain null values; the \"LABEL\" and \"NOTES\" fields do.\nThe \"RANK\" field is a numeric expression of the \"STATUS\" field.  Combined with the line geometry, these fields encode the views of the United States Government on the political status of the boundary line.\n\nATTRIBUTE NAME | | VALUE |\nRANK | 1 | 2 | 3\nSTATUS | International Boundary | Other Line of International Separation | Special Line\n\nA value of “1” in the “RANK” field corresponds to an \"International Boundary\" value in the “STATUS” field.  Values of ”2” and “3” correspond to “Other Line of International Separation” and “Special Line,” respectively.\n\nThe “LABEL” field contains required text to describe the line segment on all finished cartographic products, including but not limited to print and interactive maps.  \n\nThe “NOTES” field contains an explanation of special circumstances modifying the lines.  This information can pertain to the origins of the boundary lines, limitations regarding the purpose of the lines, or the original source of the line.\n\nUse of Core Attributes in Cartographic Visualization \n\nSeveral of the Core Attributes provide information required for the proper cartographic representation of the LSIB dataset.  The cartographic usage of the LSIB requires a visual differentiation between the three categories of boundary lines.  Specifically, this differentiation must be between:\n\n- International Boundaries (Rank 1);\n- Other Lines of International Separation (Rank 2); and\n- Special Lines (Rank 3).\n\nRank 1 lines must be the most visually prominent.  Rank 2 lines must be less visually prominent than Rank 1 lines.  Rank 3 lines must be shown in a manner visually subordinate to Ranks 1 and 2.  Where scale permits, Rank 2 and 3 lines must be labeled in accordance with the “Label” field.  Data marked with a Rank 2 or 3 designation does not necessarily correspond to a disputed boundary.  Please consult the style files in the download package for examples of this depiction.\n\nThe requirement to incorporate the contents of the \"LABEL\" field on cartographic products is scale dependent.  If a label is legible at the scale of a given static product, a proper use of this dataset would encourage the application of that label.  Using the contents of the \"COUNTRY1\" and \"COUNTRY2\" fields in the generation of a line segment label is not required.  The \"STATUS\" field contains the preferred description for the three LSIB line types when they are incorporated into a map legend but is otherwise not to be used for labeling. \n\nUse of the “CC1,” “CC1_GENC3,” “CC2,” “CC2_GENC3,” “RANK,” or “NOTES” fields for cartographic labeling purposes is prohibited.\n\nExtension Attributes\n\nCertain elements of the attributes within the LSIB dataset extend data functionality to make the data more interoperable or to provide clearer linkages to other datasets.\n\nThe fields “CC1_GENC3” and “CC2_GENC” contain the corresponding three-character GENC code to the “CC1” and “CC2” attributes.  The code “QX2” is the three-character counterpart of the code “Q2,” which denotes a line in the LSIB representing a boundary associated with a geographic area not contained within the GENC standard.\n\nTo allow for linkage between individual lines in the LSIB and World Polygons dataset, the “CC1_WPID” and “CC2_WPID” fields contain a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID), version 4, which provides a stable description of each geographic entity in a boundary pair relationship.  Each UUID corresponds to a geographic entity listed in the World Polygons dataset.  These fields allow for linkage between individual lines in the LSIB and the overall World Polygons dataset. \n\nFive additional fields in the LSIB expand on the UUID concept and either describe features that have changed across space and time or indicate relationships between previous versions of the feature.\n\n1. The “LSIB_ID” attribute is a UUID value that defines a specific instance of a feature.  Any change to the feature in a lineset requires a new “LSIB_ID.”\n2. The “ANTECIDS,” or antecedent ID, is a UUID that references line geometries from which a given line is descended in time.  It is used when there is a feature that is entirely new, not when there is a new version of a previous feature.  This is generally used to reference countries that have dissolved.\n3. The “PREVIDS,” or Previous ID, is a UUID field that contains old versions of a line.  This is an additive field, that houses all Previous IDs.  A new version of a feature is defined by any change to the feature—either line geometry or attribute—but it is still conceptually the same feature.\n4. The “PARENTID” field introduces a concept of hierarchy into the data model.  This UUID field links related Rank 2 and Rank 3 lines to their corresponding Rank 1 line.  If two political entities share multiple boundary lines of different Rank or Status, this field contains an identifier that assembles all line segments together.\n5. The “PARENTSEG” field, which is a future-use field, contains information pertaining to constituent parts of a boundary line of the same rank or status.\n\nExternal Data Sources\n\nCertain elements of the LSIB incorporate elements of other published data sources. These include: \n\n- Geopolitical Entities, Names, and Codes Registry: https://nsgreg.nga.mil/GENC-overview.jsp\n- U.S. Department of State List of Independent States in the World: https://www.state.gov/independent-states-in-the-world/\n- U.S. Department of State List of Dependencies and Areas of Special Sovereignty: https://www.state.gov/dependencies-and-areas-of-special-sovereignty/\n- U.S. Department of State Boundaries and Sovereignty Encyclopedia (BASE): https://statetoday.net/base (USG only)\n\nThe LSIB also includes elements of two other NGDAs: \n\n- The source for the U.S.—Canada international boundary (NGDAID97) is the International Boundary Commission: https://www.internationalboundarycommission.org/en/maps-coordinates/coordinates.php\n- The source for the “International Boundary between the United States of America and the United States of Mexico” (NGDAID82) is the International Boundary and Water Commission: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?q=usibwc",

The primary risk classifications used are the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event, the 0.2-percent-annual-chance flood event, and areas of minimal flood risk. The NFHL data are derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), flood hazard analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data where available. The FISs and FIRMs are published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The specifications for the horizontal control of DFIRM data are consistent with those required for mapping at a scale\n\t\t\t\tof 1:12,000. The NFHL data contain layers in the Standard DFIRM datasets except for S_Label_Pt and S_Label_Ld. The NFHL is available as State or US Territory data sets.

    "description": "The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.\n\nThe primary legal divisions of most states are termed counties. In Louisiana, these divisions are known as parishes. In Alaska, which has no counties, the equivalent entities are the organized boroughs, city and boroughs, municipalities, and for the unorganized area, census areas. The latter are delineated cooperatively for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau. In four states (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia), there are one or more incorporated places that are independent of any county organization and thus constitute primary divisions of their states. These incorporated places are known as independent cities and are treated as equivalent entities for purposes of data presentation. The District of Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions, and each area is considered an equivalent entity for purposes of data presentation. The Census Bureau treats the following entities as equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentation: Municipios in Puerto Rico, Districts and Islands in American Samoa, Municipalities in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Islands in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The entire area of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas is covered by counties or equivalent entities.\n\nThe boundaries for counties and equivalent entities are as of January 1, 2019, primarily as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published — CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n† Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

This dataset contains U.S. disaster cost assessments of the total, direct losses ($) inflicted by: tropical cyclones, inland floods, drought & heat waves, severe local storms (i.e., tornado, hail, straight-line wind damage), wildfires, crop freeze events and winter storms. These assessments require input from a variety of public and private data sources including: the Insurance Services Office (ISO) Property Claim Services (PCS), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and Presidential Disaster Declaration (PDD) assistance, and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) & Risk Management Agency (RMA), the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) and state agency reporting, among others. Each of these data sources provides unique information as part of the overall disaster loss assessment.",

FEMA administers three programs that provide funding for eligible mitigation planning and projects to reduce disaster losses and protect life and property from future disaster damages. The three programs are the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) grant program, and Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) grant program. This dataset also contains data from the HMA grant programs that were eliminated by the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 (BW-12): Repetitive Flood Claims (RFC) grant program and Severe Repetitive Loss (SRL) grant program. For more information on the Hazard Mitigation Assistance grant programs, please visit: https://www.fema.gov/grants/mitigation.rnrnThis is raw, unedited data from FEMA's mitigation grant systems (NEMIS-MT and e-Grants) and as such is subject to a small percentage of human error. The financial information is derived from FEMA's mitigation grant systems and not FEMA's official financial systems. Due to differences in reporting periods, status of obligations and how business rules are applied, this financial information may differ slightly from official publication on public websites such as usaspending.gov; this dataset is not intended to be used for any official federal financial reporting.rnrnMissing values - In some cases data was not provided by the subgrantee (subrecipient), grantee (recipient) and/or entered into the FEMA mitigation grant systems. The information is likely available as part of the paper file which is considered the file of record.rnrnrnA newer version of this OpenFEMA data set has been released. This older dataset version will no longer be updated and will be archived by the end of April 2020. The following page details the latest version of this data set: https://www.fema.gov/openfema-data-page/hazard-mitigation-assistance-projects-v2.

The primary source for the data is cadastral survey records housed by the BLM supplemented with local records and geographic control coordinates from states, counties as well as other federal agencies such as the USGS and USFS. The data has been converted from source documents to digital form and transferred into a GIS format that is compliant with FGDC Cadastral Data Content Standards and Guidelines for publication. This data is optimized for data publication and sharing rather than for specific 'production' or operation and maintenance. This data set includes the following: PLSS Fully Intersected (all of the PLSS feature at the atomic or smallest polygon level), PLSS Townships, First Divisions and Second Divisions (the hierarchical break down of the PLSS Rectangular surveys), and the Bureau of Census 2015 Cartographic State Boundaries. The Entity-Attribute section of this metadata describes these components in greater detail. Please note that the data on this site, although published at regular intervals, may not be the most current PLSS data that is available from the BLM. Updates to the PLSS data at the BLM State Offices may have occurred since this data was published. To ensure users have the most current data, please contact the BLM PLSS Data Set Manager.</p>",

The dataset can also be filtered by recall type: tires, vehicles, car seats, and equipment. The earliest campaign data is from 1966. The dataset displays the completion rate from the latest Recall Quarterly Report or Annual Report data from Year 2015 Quarter 1 (2015-1) onward.\n\nData Reporting Requirement:\nManufacturers who determine that a product or piece of original equipment either contains a safety defect or is not in compliance with Federal safety standards are required to notify NHTSA within 5 business days. NHTSA requires that manufacturers file a Defect and Noncompliance Report in compliance with Federal Regulation 49 (the National Traffic and Motor Safety Act) Part 573, which identifies the requirements for safety recalls. This information is stored in the NHTSA database referenced above.\n\nNotes:\nThe default visualization depicted here represents only the top 12 manufacturers for the current calendar year. Please use the Filters for specific data requests. For a complete historical perspective, please visit:\nhttps://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/2023-03/2022-Recalls-Annual-Report_030223-tag.pdf.",

Specifically, the data set identifies Antiretroviral (ARV) and HIV lab shipments to supported countries. In addition, the data set provides the commodity pricing and associated supply chain expenses necessary to move the commodities to countries for use. The dataset has similar fields to the Global Fund's Price, Quality and Reporting (PQR) data. PEPFAR and the Global Fund represent the two largest procurers of HIV health commodities. This dataset, when analyzed in conjunction with the PQR data, provides a more complete picture of global spending on specific health commodities. The data are particularly valuable for understanding ranges and trends in pricing as well as volumes delivered by country. The US Government believes this data will help stakeholders make better, data-driven decisions. Care should be taken to consider contextual factors when using the database. Conclusions related to costs associated with moving specific line items or products to specific countries and lead times by product/country will not be accurate.",

The NIS is designed to produce U.S. regional and national estimates of inpatient utilization, access, cost, quality, and outcomes. Unweighted, it contains data from more than 7 million hospital stays each year. Weighted, it estimates more than 35 million hospitalizations nationally. Developed through a Federal-State-Industry partnership sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), HCUP data inform decision making at the national, State, and community levels.\n\nStarting with the 2012 data year, the NIS is a sample of discharges from all hospitals participating in HCUP, covering more than 97 percent of the U.S. population. For prior years, the NIS was a sample of hospitals. The NIS allows for weighted national estimates to identify, track, and analyze national trends in health care utilization, access, charges, quality, and outcomes. The NIS's large sample size enables analyses of rare conditions, such as congenital anomalies; uncommon treatments, such as organ transplantation; and special patient populations, such as the uninsured. NIS data are available since 1988, allowing analysis of trends over time. \n\nThe NIS inpatient data include clinical and resource use information typically available from discharge abstracts with safeguards to protect the privacy of individual patients, physicians, and hospitals (as required by data sources).  Data elements include but are not limited to: diagnoses, procedures, discharge status, patient demographics (e.g., sex, age), total charges, length of stay, and expected payment source, including but not limited to Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance, self-pay, or those billed as ‘no charge’. The NIS excludes data elements that could directly or indirectly identify individuals. \n\nRestricted access data files are available with a data use agreement and brief online security training.",

Most data collected by the CRDC are disaggregated by race, ethnicity, sex, disability, and English Learners.\r\n\r\nOriginally known as the Elementary and Secondary School Civil Rights Survey, OCR began by collecting data every year from 1968 to 1974 from a sample of school districts and their schools. Over time, the schedule and approach to data collection has changed. Since the 2011-12 collection, the CRDC has been administered every two years to all public school districts and schools in the 50 states and Washington, D.C., and OCR added the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico for the 2017-18 CRDC. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic that resulted in school closures nationwide, OCR postponed the 2019-20 CRDC and instead collected data from the 2020-21 school year.",

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.\n\n\nThe Coastline Shapefile includes all features within the MTDB Class \"Coastline\" distinguished where the MAF/TIGER Feature Classification Code (MTFCC) for the feature in MTDB is L4150. The coastline included in this shapefile was delineated by the Census Bureau in the MAF/TIGER database based on water measurement class for display of statistical information only; its depiction and designation for statistical purposes does not constitute a determination of jurisdictional authority or rights of ownership or entitlement and it is not a legal land description. This shapefile should be used for data presentation purposes only.  It is not the official source for the coastline feature. The name assigned to each Coastline feature is a short form of the name of the large body of water bordered by this Coastline feature.\n",

The file includes the following population items: sex, age, race, Hispanic or Latino origin, household relationship, and household and family characteristics. Housing items include occupancy status and tenure (whether the unit is owner or renter occupied). SF1 does not include information on incomes, poverty status, overcrowded housing or age of housing. These topics will be covered in Summary File 3. Data are available for states, counties, county subdivisions, places, census tracts, block groups, and, where applicable, American Indian and Alaskan Native Areas and Hawaiian Home Lands. The SF1 data are available on the Bureau's web site and may be retrieved from American FactFinder as tables, lists, or maps. Users may also download a set of compressed ASCII files for each state via the Bureau's FTP server. There are over 8000 data items available for each geographic area. The full listing of these data items is available here as a downloadable compressed data base file named TABLES.ZIP. The uncompressed is in FoxPro data base file (dbf) format and may be imported to ACCESS, EXCEL, and other software formats. While all of this information is useful, the Office of Community Planning and Development has downloaded selected information for all states and areas and is making this information available on the CPD web pages. The tables and data items selected are those items used in the CDBG and HOME allocation formulas plus topics most pertinent to the Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS), the Consolidated Plan, and similar overall economic and community development plans. The information is contained in five compressed (zipped) dbf tables for each state. When uncompressed the tables are ready for use with FoxPro and they can be imported into ACCESS, EXCEL, and other spreadsheet, GIS and database software. The data are at the block group summary level. The first two characters of the file name are the state abbreviation. The next two letters are BG for block group. Each record is labeled with the code and name of the city and county in which it is located so that the data can be summarized to higher-level geography. The last part of the file name describes the contents . The GEO file contains standard Census Bureau geographic identifiers for each block group, such as the metropolitan area code and congressional district code. The only data included in this table is total population and total housing units. POP1 and POP2 contain selected population variables and selected housing items are in the HU file. The MA05 table data is only for use by State CDBG grantees for the reporting of the racial composition of beneficiaries of Area Benefit activities. The complete package for a state consists of the dictionary file named TABLES, and the five data files for the state. The logical record number (LOGRECNO) links the records across tables.",

    "title": "Homicides in New York City, 1797-1999 [And Various Historical Comparison Sites]",
    "description": "There has been little research on United States homicide\r\nrates from a long-term perspective, primarily because there has been\r\nno consistent data series on a particular place preceding the Uniform\r\nCrime Reports (UCR), which began its first full year in 1931. To fill\r\nthis research gap, this project created a data series on homicides per\r\ncapita for New York City that spans two centuries. The goal was to\r\ncreate a site-specific, individual-based data series that could be\r\nused to examine major social shifts related to homicide, such as mass\r\nimmigration, urban growth, war, demographic changes, and changes in\r\nlaws. Data were also gathered on various other sites, particularly in\r\nEngland, to allow for comparisons on important issues, such as the\r\npost-World War II wave of violence. The basic approach to the data\r\ncollection was to obtain the best possible estimate of annual counts\r\nand the most complete information on individual homicides. The annual\r\ncount data (Parts 1 and 3) were derived from multiple sources,\r\nincluding the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reports\r\nand Supplementary Homicide Reports, as well as other official counts\r\nfrom the New York City Police Department and the City Inspector in the\r\nearly 19th century. The data include a combined count of murder and\r\nmanslaughter because charge bargaining often blurs this legal\r\ndistinction. The individual-level data (Part 2) were drawn from\r\ncoroners' indictments held by the New York City Municipal Archives,\r\nand from daily newspapers. Duplication was avoided by keeping a record\r\nfor each victim. The estimation technique known as \"capture-recapture\"\r\nwas used to estimate homicides not listed in either source. Part 1\r\nvariables include counts of New York City homicides, arrests, and\r\nconvictions, as well as the homicide rate, race or ethnicity and\r\ngender of victims, type of weapon used, and source of data. Part 2\r\nincludes the date of the murder, the age, sex, and race of the\r\noffender and victim, and whether the case led to an arrest, trial,\r\nconviction, execution, or pardon. Part 3 contains annual homicide\r\ncounts and rates for various comparison sites including Liverpool,\r\nLondon, Kent, Canada, Baltimore, Los Angeles, Seattle, and San\r\nFrancisco.",

    "description": "Investigator(s): United States Department of Justice. Federal Bureau of Investigation\r\nThe National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) series is a component part of the Uniform Crime Reporting Program (UCR), a nationwide view of crime administered by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), based on the submission of crime information by participating law enforcement agencies. The NIBRS was implemented to meet the new guidelines formulated for the UCR to provide new ways of looking at crime for the 21st century. NIBRS is an expanded and enhanced UCR Program, designed to capture incident-level data and data focused on various aspects of a crime incident. The NIBRS was aimed at offering law enforcement and the academic community more comprehensive data than ever before available for management, training, planning, research, and other uses. NIBRS collects data on each single incident and arrest within 22 offense categories made up of 46 specific crimes called Group A offenses. In addition, there are 11 Group B offense categories for which only arrest data are reported. NIBRS data on different aspects of crime incidents such as offenses, victims, offenders, arrestees, etc., can be examined as different units of analysis. The data are archived at ICPSR as 13 separate data files, which may be merged by using linkage variables.\r\nNACJD has prepared a resource guide on NIBRS.",

PLACES covers the entire United States—50 states and the District of Columbia—at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area levels. It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at four geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. This dataset includes estimates for 40 measures: 12 for health outcomes, 7 for preventive services use, 4 for chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, 7 for disabilities, 3 for health status, and 7 for health-related social needs. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates are Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2022 or 2021 data, Census Bureau 2022 county population estimate data, and American Community Survey 2018–2022 estimates. The 2024 release uses 2022 BRFSS data for 36 measures and 2021 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, high cholesterol, cholesterol screening, and taking medicine for high blood pressure control among those with high blood pressure) that the survey collects data on every other year.

    "title": "Smart Location Database",
    "description": "A large body of research has demonstrated that land use and urban form can have a significant effect on transportation outcomes. People who live and/or work in compact neighborhoods with a walkable street grid and easy access to public transit, jobs, stores, and services are more likely to have several transportation options to meet their everyday needs. As a result, they can choose to drive less, which reduces their emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants compared to people who live and work in places that are not location efficient. Walking, biking, and taking public transit can also save people money and improve their health by encouraging physical activity.\n\nThe Smart Location Database summarizes several demographic, employment, and built environment variables for every census block group (CBG) in the United States. The database includes indicators of the commonly cited “D” variables shown in the transportation research literature to be related to travel behavior.  The Ds include residential and employment density, land use diversity, design of the built environment, access to destinations, and distance to transit. SLD variables can be used as inputs to travel demand models, baseline data for scenario planning studies, and combined into composite indicators characterizing the relative location efficiency of CBG within U.S. metropolitan regions.\n\nThis update features the most recent geographic boundaries (2019 Census Block Groups) and new and expanded sources of data used to calculate variables. Entirely new variables have been added and the methods used to calculate some of the SLD variables have changed.\n\nMore information on the National Walkability index: https://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/smart-location-mapping\nMore information on the Smart Location Calculator: https://www.slc.gsa.gov/slc/\n",

If necessary, this version can be accessed by contacting NCEI.*The Integrated Surface Dataset (ISD) is composed of worldwide surface weather observations from over 35,000 stations, though the best spatial coverage is evident in North America, Europe, Australia, and parts of Asia. Parameters included are: air quality, atmospheric pressure, atmospheric temperature/dew point, atmospheric winds, clouds, precipitation, ocean waves, tides and more. ISD refers to the data contained within the digital database as well as the format in which the hourly, synoptic (3-hourly), and daily weather observations are stored. The format conforms to Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS). ISD provides hourly data that can be used in a wide range of climatological applications. For some stations, data may go as far back as 1901, though most data show a substantial increase in volume in the 1940s and again in the early 1970s. Currently, there are over 14,000 \"active\" stations updated daily in the database.\n\nFor user convenience, a subset of just the hourly data is available to users for download.

    "title": "IPAWS Archived Alerts",
    "description": "The Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS) is a modernization of the nation's alert and warning infrastructure that unifies the United States' Emergency Alert System (EAS), Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Radio, and other public alerting systems implemented as a set of Web services. Organized and managed by FEMA, the system supports alert origination by Federal, state, local, territorial and tribal officials, and subsequent dissemination to the public using a range of national and local alerting systems. This dataset contains recent*, historic, and archived IPAWS Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) v1.2 messages from June 2012 to the present including date, time, event code (examples listed below), city, county, joint agency, police, law enforcement, Collaborative Operating Group (COG), State(s), locality, territory or tribe. It can be used to capture and analyze historic and archived messages. *The dataset is published with a twenty-four (24) hour delay to reduce the risk of being confused with an active alert received from the live IPAWS feed. The most recent record will reflect the alert(s) sent twenty-four (24) hours ago (if such records exist). For example, if an alert originator sent an alert at 1459GMT on June 1st and sent a different alert at 1600GMT on June 2nd, these alerts will not be visible in the dataset until 1459GMT on June 2nd and 1600GMT June 3rd respectively. Information on signing up for receiving active alerts can be found at https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/practitioners/integrated-public-alert-warning-system . To request access to alerts issued through IPAWS or for a list of companies with access to the IPAWS All-Hazards Information Feed, email ipaws@fema.dhs.gov. The data elements within the CAP messages are well documented and can be found in the following technical document: https://docs.oasis-open.org/emergency/cap/v1.2/CAP-v1.2-os.pdf See also: IPAWS Architecture - https://www.fema.gov/pdf/emergency/ipaws/architecture_diagram.pdf IPAWS Overview - https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/practitioners/integrated-public-alert-warning-system This is raw, unedited data with no personally identifiable information from the IPAWS Alert Aggregator from June 2012 to the present created by over 1450 Alert Originators across the country. FEMA does not validate the content of each message. As such, it may contain a small percentage of human error. OpenFEMA does not have a full backup capability so if the site goes down, the information will be inaccessible. This is a rare occurrence. Earlier messages may contain non-compliant geocoordinates. Recent versions of the software check these coordinates for compliance. This dataset is not intended to be an official federal report and should not be considered an official federal report. If you are using this site for other than research purposes, please understand that these CAP messages are captured only after the official IPAWS message has been sent. Note that the original IPAWS CAP message is provided in the originalMessage element of the returned JSON object. The XML based message is encoded such that a separate tool, such as a JSON parser, computer language, or browser must be used to view the original format. See the originalMessage field description for additional details. Due to its size and its hierarchical data structure, working with the IPAWS Archived Alerts file can be challenging. See the OpenFEMA Guide to Working with Large Data Sets page for useful hints and tips: https://www.fema.gov/about/openfema/working-with-large-data-sets . The Developer Resources page has sample IPAWS API queries in the section called IPAWS Archived Alerts Query Examples: https://www.fema.gov/about/openfema/developer-resources",

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.\n\nAmerican Indian tribal subdivisions are administrative subdivisions of federally recognized American Indian reservations/off-reservation trust lands or Oklahoma tribal statistical areas (OTSAs).  These entities are internal units of self-government and/or administration that serve social, cultural, and/or economic purposes for the American Indian tribe or tribes on the reservations/off-reservation trust lands or OTSAs.  The Census Bureau obtains the boundary and attribute information for tribal subdivisions on federally recognized American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands from federally recognized tribal governments through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).  For the 2020 Census, the boundaries for tribal subdivisions on OTSAs were also obtained from federally recognized tribal governments through the Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP). Note that tribal subdivisions do not exist on all reservations/off-reservation trust lands or OTSAs, rather only where they were submitted to the Census Bureau by the federally recognized tribal government for that area.  \n\nThe boundaries for American Indian tribal subdivisions are as of January 1, 2020, as reported by the federally recognized tribal governments through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).\n\nThe boundaries for tribal subdivisions on OTSAs are those reported as of January 1, 2020 through PSAP.\n",

    "title": "Li-ion Battery Aging Datasets",
    "description": "This data set has been collected from a custom built battery prognostics testbed at the NASA Ames Prognostics Center of Excellence (PCoE). Li-ion batteries were run through 3 different operational profiles (charge, discharge and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy) at different temperatures. Discharges were carried out at different current load levels until the battery voltage fell to preset voltage thresholds. Some of these thresholds were lower than that recommended by the OEM (2.7 V) in order to induce deep discharge aging effects. Repeated charge and discharge cycles result in accelerated aging of the batteries. The experiments were stopped when the batteries reached the end-of-life (EOL) criteria of 30% fade in rated capacity (from 2 Ah to 1.4 Ah).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**Data Acquisition:**\r\n\r\n     The testbed comprises:\r\n\r\n    * Commercially available Li-ion 18650 sized rechargeable batteries,\r\n    * Programmable 4-channel DC electronic load,\r\n    * Programmable 4-channel DC power supply,\r\n    * Voltmeter, ammeter and thermocouple sensor suite,\r\n    * Custom EIS equipment,\r\n    * Environmental chamber to impose various operational conditions,\r\n    * PXI chassis based DAQ and experiment control, and\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMATLAB based experiment control, data acquisition and prognostics algorithm evaluation setup (appx. data acquisition rate is 10Hz).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**Parameter Description:**\r\n\r\n     Data Structure:\r\n\r\n     cycle: top level structure array containing the charge, discharge and impedance operations\r\n\r\n     type: operation  type, can be charge, discharge or impedance\r\n\r\n     ambient_temperature: ambient temperature (degree C)\r\n\r\n     time: the date and time of the start of the cycle, in MATLAB  date vector format\r\n\r\n     data: data structure containing the measurements\r\n\r\n        for charge the fields are:\r\n\r\n            Voltage_measured: Battery terminal voltage (Volts)\r\n\r\n            Current_measured: Battery output current (Amps)\r\n\r\n            Temperature_measured: Battery temperature (degree C)\r\n\r\n            Current_charge: Current measured at charger (Amps)\r\n\r\n            Voltage_charge: Voltage measured at charger (Volts)\r\n\r\n            Time: Time vector for the cycle (secs)\r\n\r\n        for discharge the fields are:\r\n\r\n            Voltage_measured: Battery terminal voltage (Volts)\r\n\r\n            Current_measured: Battery output current (Amps)\r\n\r\n            Temperature_measured: Battery temperature (degree C)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n            Current_charge: Current measured at load (Amps)\r\n\r\n            Voltage_charge: Voltage measured at load (Volts)\r\n\r\n            Time: Time vector for the cycle (secs)\r\n\r\n            Capacity: Battery capacity (Ahr) for discharge till 2.7V\r\n\r\n        for impedance the fields are:\r\n\r\n            Sense_current: Current in sense branch (Amps)\r\n\r\n            Battery_current: Current in battery branch (Amps)\r\n\r\n            Current_ratio: Ratio of the above currents\r\n\r\n            Battery_impedance: Battery impedance (Ohms) computed from raw data\r\n\r\n            Rectified_impedance: Calibrated and smoothed battery impedance (Ohms)\r\n\r\n            Re: Estimated electrolyte resistance (Ohms)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n            Rct: Estimated charge transfer resistance (Ohms) \r\n\r\n**Intended Use:**\r\n\r\nThe data sets can serve for a variety of purposes. Because these are essentially a large number of Run-to-Failure time series, the data can be set for development of prognostic algorithms. In particular, due to the differences in depth-of-discharge (DOD), the duration of rest periods and intrinsic variability, no two cells have the same state-of-life (SOL) at the same cycle index. The aim is to be able to manage this uncertainty, which is representative of actual usage, and make reliable predictions of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) in both the End-of-Discharge (EOD) and End-of-Life (EOL) contexts.",

    "title": "NOAA Next Generation Radar (NEXRAD) Level 2 Base Data",
    "description": "This dataset consists of Level II weather radar data collected from Next-Generation Radar (NEXRAD) stations located in the contiguous United States, Alaska, Hawaii, U.S. territories and at military base sites. NEXRAD is a network of 160 high-resolution Doppler weather radars operated by the NOAA National Weather Service (NWS), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the U.S. Air Force (USAF). Doppler radars detect atmospheric precipitation and winds, which allow scientists to track and anticipate weather events, such as rain, ice pellets, snow, hail, and tornadoes, as well as some non-weather objects like birds and insects. NEXRAD stations use the Weather Surveillance Radar - 1988, Doppler (WSR-88D) system. This is a 10 cm wavelength (S-Band) radar that operates at a frequency between 2,700 and 3,000 MHz. The radar system operates in two basic modes: a slow-scanning Clear Air Mode (Mode B) for analyzing air movements when there is little or no precipitation activity in the area, and a Precipitation Mode (Mode A) with a faster scan for tracking active weather. The two modes employ nine Volume Coverage Patterns (VCPs) to adequately sample the atmosphere based on weather conditions. A VCP is a series of 360 degree sweeps of the antenna at pre-determined elevation angles and pulse repetition frequencies completed in a specified period of time. The radar scan times 4.5, 5, 6 or 10 minutes depending on the selected VCP. The NEXRAD products are divided into multiple data processing levels. The lower Level II data contain the three meteorological base data quantities at original resolution: reflectivity, mean radial velocity, and spectrum width. With the advent of dual polarization beginning in 2011, additional base products of differential reflectivity, correlation coefficient and differential phase are available. Level II data are recorded at all NWS and most USAF and FAA WSR-88D sites. From the Level II quantities, computer processing generates numerous meteorological analysis Level 3 products. NEXRAD data are acquired by the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) for archiving and dissemination to users. Data coverage varies by station and ranges from June 1991 to 1 day from present. Most stations began observing in the mid-1990s, and most period of records are continuous.",

    "description": "Click “Export” on the right to download the vehicle trajectory data. The associated metadata and additional data can be downloaded below under \"Attachments\".\n\nResearchers for the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM)  program collected detailed vehicle trajectory data on southbound US 101 and Lankershim Boulevard in Los Angeles, CA, eastbound I-80 in Emeryville, CA and Peachtree Street in Atlanta, Georgia. Data was collected through a network of synchronized digital video cameras. NGVIDEO, a customized software application developed for the NGSIM program, transcribed the vehicle trajectory data from the video. This vehicle trajectory data provided the precise location of each vehicle within the study area every one-tenth of a second, resulting in detailed lane positions and locations relative to other vehicles. Click the \"Show More\" button below to find additional contextual data and metadata for this dataset. \n\nFor site-specific NGSIM video file datasets, please see the following:\n- NGSIM I-80 Videos: https://data.transportation.gov/Automobiles/Next-Generation-Simulation-NGSIM-Program-I-80-Vide/2577-gpny\n- NGSIM US-101 Videos: https://data.transportation.gov/Automobiles/Next-Generation-Simulation-NGSIM-Program-US-101-Vi/4qzi-thur\n- NGSIM Lankershim Boulevard Videos: https://data.transportation.gov/Automobiles/Next-Generation-Simulation-NGSIM-Program-Lankershi/uv3e-y54k\n- NGSIM Peachtree Street Videos: https://data.transportation.gov/Automobiles/Next-Generation-Simulation-NGSIM-Program-Peachtree/mupt-aksf",

The explanation from Office of Planning regarding how the agency created their list:</span></p><p style=\"margin:1 1 1 20;\"><span>“To determine the number of grocery stores in the District, we analyzed existing business licenses in the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (2018) Business License Verification system (located at </span><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://eservices.dcra.dc.gov/BBLV/Default.aspx\"><span><u>https://eservices.dcra.dc.gov/BBLV/Default.aspx</u></span></a><span>). To distinguish grocery stores from convenience stores, we applied the Alcohol Beverage and Cannabis Administration’s (ABCA) definition of a full-service grocery store. This definition requires a store to be licensed as a grocery store, sell at least six different food categories, dedicate either 50% of the store’s total square feet or 6,000 square feet to selling food, and dedicate at least 5% of the selling area to each food category. This definition can be found at </span><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://abca.dc.gov:443/page/full-service-grocery-store\"><span><u>https://abca.dc.gov/page/full-service-grocery-store#gsc.tab=0</u></span></a><span>. To distinguish small grocery stores from large grocery stores, we categorized large grocery stores as those 10,000 square feet or more. This analysis was conducted using data from the WDCEP’s Retail and Restaurants webpage (located at </span><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://wdcep.com/dc-industries/retail/\"><span><u>https://wdcep.com/dc-industries/retail/</u></span></a><span>) and using ARCGIS Spatial Analysis tools when existing data was not available. Our final numbers differ slightly from existing reports like the DC Hunger Solutions’ Closing the Grocery Store Gap and WDCEP’s Grocery Store Opportunities Map; this difference likely comes from differences in our methodology and our exclusion of stores that have closed.”</span></p><p><span>Staff also conducted a visual analysis of locations and relied on personal experience of visits to locations to determine whether they should be included in the list.</span></p></div></div></div>",

The global model is forced with NOAA/NCEP's Global Forecast System (GFS) winds. This model is designed to capture the large-scale ocean waves and provide spectral boundary conditions for the Hawaii and other Pacific regional WW3 models. While considerable effort has been made to implement all model components in a thorough, correct, and accurate manner, numerous sources of error are possible.

    "description": "Crash data shows information about each traffic crash on city streets within the City of Chicago limits and under the jurisdiction of Chicago Police Department (CPD). Data are shown as is from the electronic crash reporting system (E-Crash) at CPD, excluding any personally identifiable information. Records are added to the data portal when a crash report is finalized or when amendments are made to an existing report in E-Crash. Data from E-Crash are available for some police districts in 2015, but citywide data are not available until September 2017. About half of all crash reports, mostly minor crashes, are self-reported at the police district by the driver(s) involved and the other half are recorded at the scene by the police officer responding to the crash. Many of the crash parameters, including street condition data, weather condition, and posted speed limits, are recorded by the reporting officer based on best available information at the time, but many of these may disagree with posted information or other assessments on road conditions. If any new or updated information on a crash is received, the reporting officer may amend the crash report at a later time. A traffic crash within the city limits for which CPD is not the responding police agency, typically crashes on interstate highways, freeway ramps, and on local roads along the City boundary, are excluded from this dataset.\n\nAll crashes are recorded as per the format specified in the Traffic Crash Report, SR1050, of the Illinois Department of Transportation. The crash data published on the Chicago data portal mostly follows the data elements in SR1050 form. The current version of the SR1050 instructions manual with detailed information on each data elements is available <a href=\"https://idot.illinois.gov/Assets/uploads/files/Transportation-System/Manuals-Guides-&-Handbooks/Safety/Illinois Traffic Crash Report SR 1050 Instruction Manual 2019.pdf\">here</a>.\n\nAs per Illinois statute, only crashes with a property damage value of $1,500 or more or involving bodily injury to any person(s) and that happen on a public roadway and that involve at least one moving vehicle, except bike dooring, are considered reportable crashes. However, CPD records every reported traffic crash event, regardless of the statute of limitations, and hence any formal Chicago crash dataset released by Illinois Department of Transportation may not include all the crashes listed here.\n\nChange 11/21/2023: We have removed the RD_NO (Chicago Police Department report number) for privacy reasons.",

    "title": "Rare Earth Element Occurrences in the United States",
    "description": "Version 4.0 of this data release provides descriptions of more than 200 mineral districts, mines, and mineral occurrences (deposits, prospects, and showings) within the United States that are reported to contain substantial enrichments of the rare earth elements (REEs). These mineral occurrences include mined deposits, exploration prospects, and other occurrences with notable concentrations of the REEs. The inclusion of a particular mineral occurrence in this database is not meant to imply that it has economic potential. Rather, these occurrences were included to capture the distribution and characteristics of the known, reported REEs deposits in the United States, which are diverse in their geology and resource potential.\nConcentrated, mineable deposits of the REEs are rare, such that most of the sites within this data release are for unmined locations where the published information may not contain thorough descriptions (Van Gosen and others, 2014). Therefore, decisions had to be made by the authors regarding the addition or exclusion of specific REE occurrences in the dataset, based principally on the available descriptions of the REE concentrations and the apparent size of the mineralized body. The level of detail of this type of information varied widely amongst the occurrences, ranging from general descriptions to detailed sampling and analysis of some deposits.\nThe entries and descriptions in the database were derived from published papers, reports, data, and internet documents representing a variety of sources, including geologic and exploration studies described in State, Federal, and industry reports. Although an attempt was made to capture as many examples as possible, this dataset is a progress report that is part of an ongoing effort. The authors welcome additional published information in order to continually update and refine this dataset.\nIn addition to the conventional resources described in this report, every year approximately 56,000 metric tons of REEs are mined, beneficiated, and put into solution, but not recovered, by operations associated with the global phosphate fertilizer industry (Emsbo and others, 2015, 2016). As indicated by Emsbo and others (2015, 2016), recovery of byproduct REEs from the phosphate industry has the potential to substantially increase the supply of REEs to the market.\nThe significant increases in applications and demands for REEs has led to an increased interest in identifying new sources that include extraction not only from mineral deposits, but also the potential for REE extraction  from coal-based resources, and recycling of products containing REEs. The Department of Energy is currently (2019) evaluating technologies to recover REEs and other critical minerals from coal and coal-based resources (https://www.netl.doe.gov/coal/rare-earth-elements). Recycling efforts have focused on recovering REEs from light bulbs and electronics. The dataset provided in this data release is restricted to non-fuel, REE-bearing mineral deposits and does not include energy resources (such as coal).\nVan Gosen, B.S., Verplanck, P.L., Long, K.R., Gambogi, Joseph, and Seal, R.R., II, 2014, The rare-earth elements—Vital to modern technologies and lifestyles: U.S. Geological Survey Fact Sheet 2014–3078, 4 p., https://dx.doi.org/10.3133/fs20143078.\nEmsbo, Poul, McLaughlin, P.I., Breit, G.N., du Bray, E.A., and Koenig, A.E., 2015, Rare earth elements in sedimentary phosphate deposits—Solution to the global REE crisis?: Gondwana Research, v. 27, p. 776–785, accessed March 13, 2019, at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gr.2014.10.008.\nEmsbo, Poul, McLaughlin, P.I., du Bray, E.A., Anderson, E.D., Vandenbroucke, T.R.A., and Zielinski, 2016, Rare earth elements in sedimentary phosphorite deposits—A global assessment, chap. 5 of Verplanck, P.L, and Hitzman, M.W., eds., Rare earth and critical elements in ore deposits: Reviews in Economic Geology, v. 18, p. 101–114, accessed March 13, 2019, at https://www.segweb.org/store/detail.aspx?id=EDOCREV18.",

    "title": "Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) - USGS National Map Downloadable Data Collection",
    "description": "The Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) is a comprehensive aggregated collection of hydrologic unit data consistent with the national criteria for delineation and resolution. It defines the areal extent of surface water drainage to a point except in coastal or lake front areas where there could be multiple outlets as stated by the \"Federal Standards and Procedures for the National Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD)\" \"Standard\" (https://pubs.usgs.gov/tm/11/a3/). Watershed boundaries are determined solely upon science-based hydrologic principles, not favoring any administrative boundaries or special projects, nor particular program or agency. This dataset represents the hydrologic unit boundaries to the 12-digit for the entire United States. Some areas may also include additional subdivisions representing the 14- and 16-digit hydrologic unit (HU). At a minimum, the HUs are delineated at 1:24,000-scale in the conterminous United States, 1:25,000-scale in Hawaii, Pacific basin and the Caribbean, and 1:63,360-scale in Alaska, meeting the National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS). Higher resolution boundaries are being developed where partners and data exist and will be incorporated back into the WBD. WBD data are delivered as a dataset of polygons and corresponding lines that define the boundary of the polygon. WBD polygon attributes include hydrologic unit codes (HUC), size (in the form of acres and square kilometers), name, downstream hydrologic unit code, type of watershed, non-contributing areas, and flow modifications. The HUC describes where the unit is in the country and the level of the unit. WBD line attributes contain the highest level of hydrologic unit for each boundary, line source information and flow modifications. For additional information on NHD, go to https://www.usgs.gov/national-hydrography.",

This includes capturing all sheds, garages, or other non-addressable buildings over 100 square feet throughout the city. Atriums, courtyards, and other “holes” in buildings created as part of demarcating the building outline are not part of the building capture. This includes construction trailers greater than 100 square feet.

Parking Garages are delineated at the perimeter of the parking garage including ramps.  Parking garages sharing a common boundary with linear features must have the common segment captured once. A parking garage is only attributed as such if there is rooftop parking.  Not all rooftop parking is a parking garage, however.

    "title": "National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH-2015)",
    "description": "<p>The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) series (formerly titled National Household Survey on Drug Abuse) primarily measures the prevalence and correlates of drug use in the United States. The surveys are designed to provide quarterly, as well as annual estimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment, and included questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing. Questions introduced in previous administrations were retained in the 2015 survey, including questions asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These \"youth experiences\" items covered a variety of topics, such as neighborhood environment, illegal activities, drug use by friends, social support, extracurricular activities, exposure to substance abuse prevention and education programs, and perceived adult attitudes toward drug use and activities such as school work. Several measures focused on prevention-related themes in this section. Also retained were questions on mental health and access to care, perceived risk of using drugs, perceived availability of drugs, driving and personal behavior, and cigar smoking. Questions on the tobacco brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey. For the 2008 survey, adult mental health questions were added to measure symptoms of psychological distress in the worst period of distress that a person experienced in the past 30 days and suicidal ideation. In 2008, a split-sample design also was included to administer separate sets of questions (WHODAS vs. SDS) to assess impairment due to mental health problems.<br />\n    Beginning with the 2009 NSDUH, however, all of the adults in the sample received only the WHODAS questions. Background information includes sex, race, age, ethnicity, marital status, educational level, job status, veteran status, and current household composition. This study has 1 Data Set.</p>",

The LEAD Tool provides estimated LMI household energy data based on income, energy expenditures, fuel type, housing type, and geography, which stakeholders can use to make data-driven decisions when planning for their energy goals. From the LEAD Tool website, users can also create and download customized heat-maps and charts for various geographies, housing, energy characteristics, and population demographics and educational attainment.\n\nDatasets are available for 50 states plus Puerto Rico and Washington D.C., along with their cities, counties, and census tracts, as well as tribal areas. The file below, \"01. Description of Files,\" provides a list of all files included in this dataset. A description of the abbreviations and units used in the LEAD Tool data can be found in the file below titled \"02. Data Dictionary 2022\". A list of geographic regions used in the LEAD Tool can be found in files 04-11.\n\nThe Low-Income Energy Affordability Data comes primarily from the 2022 U.S. Census American Community Survey 5-Year Public Use Microdata Samples and is calibrated to 2022 U.S. Energy Information Administration electric utility (Survey Form-861) and natural gas utility (Survey Form-176) data. The methodology for the LEAD Tool can viewed below (3. Methodology Document).\n\nFor more information, and to access the interactive LEAD Tool platform, please visit the \"10.

    "title": "USGS Spectral Library Version 7 Data",
    "description": "This data release provides the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Spectral Library Version 7 and all related documents. The library contains spectra measured with laboratory, field, and airborne spectrometers. The instruments used cover wavelengths from the ultraviolet to the far infrared (0.2 to 200 microns). Laboratory samples of specific minerals, plants, chemical compounds, and man-made materials were measured. In many cases, samples were purified, so that unique spectral features of a material can be related to its chemical structure. These spectro-chemical links are important for interpreting remotely sensed data collected in the field or from an aircraft or spacecraft. This library also contains physically-constructed as well as mathematically-computed mixtures. Measurements of rocks, soils, and natural mixtures of minerals have also been made with laboratory and field spectrometers. Spectra of plant components and vegetation plots, comprising many plant types and species with varying backgrounds, are also in this library. Measurements by airborne spectrometers are included for forested vegetation plots, in which the trees are too tall for measurement by a field spectrometer.  \nThe related U.S. Geological Survey Data Series publication, \"USGS Spectral Library Version 7\", describes the instruments used, metadata descriptions of spectra and samples, and possible artifacts in the spectral measurements (Kokaly and others, 2017).  \nFour different spectrometer types were used to measure spectra in the library: (1) Beckman™ 5270 covering the spectral range 0.2 to 3 µm, (2) standard, high resolution (hi-res), and high-resolution Next Generation (hi-resNG) models of ASD field portable spectrometers covering the range from 0.35 to 2.5 µm, (3) Nicolet™ Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) interferometer spectrometers covering the range from about 1.12 to 216 µm, and (4) the NASA Airborne Visible/Infra-Red Imaging Spectrometer AVIRIS, covering the range 0.37 to 2.5 µm.  \nTwo fundamental spectrometer characteristics significant for interpreting and utilizing spectral measurements are sampling position (the wavelength position of each spectrometer channel) and bandpass (a parameter describing the wavelength interval over which each channel in a spectrometer is sensitive). Bandpass is typically reported as the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) response at each channel (in wavelength units, for example nm or micron). The linked publication (Kokaly and others, 2017), includes a comparison plot of the various spectrometers used to measure the data in this release. Data for the sampling positions and the bandpass values (for each channel in the spectrometers) are included in this data release. These data are in the SPECPR files, as separate data records, and in the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) text files, as separate files for wavelength and bandpass. \nSpectra are provided in files of ASCII text format (files with a .txt file extension). In the ASCII files, deleted channels (bad bands) are indicated by a value of -1.23e34. Metadata descriptions of samples, field areas, spectral measurements, and results from supporting material analyses – such as XRD – are provided in HyperText Markup Language HTML formatted ASCII text files (files with .html file extension). In addition, Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) images of plots of spectra are provided. For each spectrum a plot with wavelength in microns on the x-axis is provided. For spectra measured on the Nicolet spectrometer, an additional GIF image with wavenumber on the x-axis is provided.  \nData are also provided in SPECtrum Processing Routines (SPECPR) format (Clark, 1993) which packages spectra and associated metadata descriptions into a single file (see the linked publication, Kokaly and others, 2017, for additional details on the SPECPR format and freely-available software than can be used to read files in SPECPR format). \nThe data measured on the source spectrometers are denoted by the “splib07a” tag in filenames. In addition to providing the original measurements, the spectra have been convolved and resampled to different spectrometer and multispectral sensor characteristics. The following list specifies the identifying tag for the measured and convolved libraries and gives brief descriptions of the sensors. \nsplib07a – this is the name of the SPECPR file containing the spectra measured on the Beckman, ASD, Nicolet and AVIRIS spectrometers. The data are provided with their original sampling positions (wavelengths) and bandpass values. The prefix “splib07a_” is at the beginning of the ASCII and GIF files pertaining to the measured spectra. \nsplib07b – this is the name of the SPECPR file containing a modified version of the original measurements. The results from using spectral convolution to convert measurements to other spectrometer characteristics can be improved by oversampling (increasing sample density). Thus, splib07b is an oversampled version of the library, computed using simple cubic-spline interpolation to produce spectra with fine sampling interval (therefore a higher number of channels) for Beckman and AVIRIS measurements. The spectra in this version of the library are the data used to create the convolved and resampled versions of the library. The prefix “splib07b_” is at the beginning of the ASCII and GIF files pertaining to the oversampled spectra. \ns07_ASD – this is the name of the SPECPR file containing the spectral library measurements convolved to standard resolution ASD full range spectrometer characteristics. The standard reported wavelengths of the ASD spectrometers used by the USGS were used (2151 channels with wavelength positions starting at 350 nm and increasing in 1 nm increments). The bandpass values of each channel were determined by comparing measurements of reference materials made on ASD spectrometers in comparison to measurements made of the same materials on higher resolution spectrometers (the procedure is described in Kokaly, 2011, and discussed in Kokaly and Skidmore, 2015, and Kokaly and others, 2017).

The oversampled spectra in splib07b were convolved to Hyperion’s average spectral characteristics (accessed January 10, 2017, at https://eo1.usgs.gov/sensors/hyperioncoverage). The prefix “s07HYPRN_” is at the beginning of the ASCII and GIF files pertaining to this spectrometer. \ns07_VIMS – this is the name of the SPECPR file containing the spectral library measurements convolved to the Cassini spacecraft’s Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) with spectral characteristics determined by Clark and others (2016), wavelength and bandpass values for the 352 channels.

The SPECPR files mentioned previously contain the resampled spectra along with their associated metadata descriptions. The filenames of these alternative SPECPR files are similar to those listed previously, except all characters are in lowercase. \nThe spectra in the data release are organized in these chapters:  \nChapter M = Minerals \nChapter S = Soils (including rocks and mineral mixtures) \nChapter C = Coatings \nChapter L = Liquids (including mixtures of liquids, water and other volatiles, and frozen volatiles) \nChapter O = Organics (including biochemical constituents of plants and chemical compounds) \nChapter A = Artificial (manmade materials, including construction materials, fabrics, manufactured chemicals, processed materials, paint pigments, plastics, and materials introduced into the environment by human activity) \nChapter V = Vegetation (including biological materials, plant components such as leaves, flowers, and bark, vegetated areas having more than one species present, lichens, biological soil crusts, and mixtures with vegetation) \nChapter M includes native elements and minerals from arsenate, borate, carbonate, halide, hydroxide, nitrate, oxide, phosphate, silicate (cyclosilicate, inosilicate, phyllosilicate, nesosilicate, sorosilicate, and tectosilicate), sulfate, and sulfide classes are represented. The chapter also contains compositional end- and intermediate-members for the olivine, garnet, scapolite, montmorillonite, muscovite, jarosite, and alunite solid-solution series. We have included representative spectra of kerogen, ammonium-bearing minerals, Lanthanide element oxides, desert varnish coatings, kaolinite crystallinity series, kaolinite-smectite series, zeolite series, and an extensive evaporite series. In some cases, a number of spectra span a compositional solid-solution series or a grain-size series or both. \nSome samples were not easily placed into a specific chapter. For example, pure minerals are often difficult to find, or it may be difficult to process the sample to purify the mineral. Such a sample could be considered a mixture. Some samples of this type were put in the minerals chapter (Chapter 1: M) because they have spectral features that are representative of one mineral in the sample. The mixture chapter (Chapter 2: S) contains spectra of multiphase samples used for identifying and mapping mixtures. Usually, the materials in these mixtures have overlapping absorption features in their spectra. The samples in the coatings chapter (Chapter 3: C) are also mixtures. However, the mineral coatings on the surfaces of the rock samples may be optically thick and obscure the spectral signatures of the underlying minerals. Frozen water, in the form of snow and ice, is included in Chapter 4: L. \nOrganic compounds are a vast category with great chemical diversity. We have added more than 200 organic compounds to a new chapter in this release of the library (Chapter 5: O). The additions are focused on compounds of smaller molecular weight that form the functional groups for larger molecules. Major groups represented include alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, aromatic hydrocarbons based on the benzene ring, and amino acids. Many of these compounds are known by multiple names because of different naming conventions and use of the common name before systematic naming conventions were created. We endeavored to use the name that was in most common use in the spectrum titles. The sample description has the Chemical Abstract Services Registry Number. The metadata descriptions also list the various names that have been applied to a particular chemical. Biochemical constituents of plants are also in this chapter of the library. Spectra of major components of plants, including lignin, cellulose, amylose, and starch, and less abundant components, including many plant phenolics, were added. \nTerrestrial remote sensing may be used in urban areas covered by manmade materials, so the library includes spectra of plastics, roofing materials, processed wood, paint, and other artificial materials (Chapter 6: A). Also in this chapter are materials that might be considered natural, for example oil and vermiculite insulation; however, they are present in the environment because of human activity or they have been altered or concentrated during a manufacturing process. In the data release, spectra of oil residues from the British Petroleum (BP) Deepwater Horizon spill (DWH) have been added. Materials that we use to process spectra and monitor the performance of our spectrometers have been added, specifically, Spectralon and mylar plastic. \nThe spectra in the vegetation chapter (Chapter 7: V) are representative of areas in which we have conducted research and for which we have published results, including: grasslands, semiarid shrublands, biological soil crusts, temperate evergreen forests, California chaparral, and coastal wetlands. The spectra span a range of measurement scales, from laboratory spectra of leaves, stems, flowers, and other plant components to remotely-sensed spectra of vegetated areas of mixed species. Because the SPECPR database file format has a limitation of 40 characters for spectrum titles, scientific names of organisms are rarely used in spectrum titles. Instead, scientific names are specified in the metadata descriptions of spectra. Spectra of leaves or a plant of a single species are often listed by a generic common name of the plant (for example, “manzanita” to represent Arctostaphylos viscida Parry). Field and AVIRIS spectra of mixed vegetation areas (plant communities) are sometimes listed by the common name of the dominant species (for example, lodgepole pine), by biome (such as grassland or shrubland), or by a land-use term (such as rangeland). In some cases, the title contains the biome name and the dominant species indicated by symbols comprising the genus and species of the dominant plant, for example, “Marsh_SPAL80%...” in the title describing a coastal wetland area where the most abundant species is Spartina alterniflora Loisel. with 80 percent (%) cover. \nAny use of trade, firm, or product names is for descriptive purposes only and does not imply endorsement by the U.S. Government. \nReferences: \nBarsi, J.

    "description": "The U.S. Daily Climate Normals for 1981 to 2010 are 30-year averages of meteorological parameters for thousands of U.S. stations located across the 50 states, as well as U.S. territories, commonwealths, the Compact of Free Association nations, and one station in Canada. NOAA Climate Normals are a large suite of data products that provide users with many tools to understand typical climate conditions for thousands of locations across the United States. As many NWS stations as possible are used, including those from the NWS Cooperative Observer Program (COOP) Network as well as some additional stations that have a Weather Bureau Army-Navy (WBAN) station identification number, including stations from the Climate Reference Network (CRN). The comprehensive U.S. Climate Normals dataset includes various derived products including daily air temperature normals (including maximum and minimum temperature normal, heating and cooling degree day normal, and others), precipitation normals (including snowfall and snow depth, percentiles, frequencies and other), and hourly normals (all normal derived from hourly data including temperature, dew point, heat index, wind chill, wind, cloudiness, heating and cooling degree hours, pressure normals). Users can access the data either by product or by station. Included in the dataset is extensive documentation to describe station metadata, filename descriptions, and methodology of producing the data. All data utilized in the computation of the 1981-2010 Climate Normals were taken from the ISD Lite (a subset of derived Integrated Surface Data), the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily dataset, and standardized monthly temperature data (COOP). These source datasets (including intermediate datasets used in the computation of products) are also archived at the NOAA NCDC.",

    "description": "NOAA, National Ocean Service, Office of Coast Survey, Marine Chart Division is responsible to build and maintain a suite of more than 1000 nautical charts that are used by commercial and recreational mariners to navigate the United States and U. S. territory waters safely.A Nautical Chart is a graphic portrayal of the marine environment. They are used to lay out courses and navigate ships by the shortest and most economically safe route. They can also serve as base maps for resource management and shoreline development planning by state and local government.Charts depict the location of the shoreline, minimum water depths, aids to navigation, hazards to navigation, the nature and form of the coast, water depths, the general character and configuration of the sea bottom, the rise and fall of the tides, protected areas, and the characteristics of the Earth's magnetism.The suite of charts is compiled and maintained with data provided by federal, state, and private partners such as the National Ocean Service elements, United States Coast Guard, United States Army Corps of Engineers, United States Power Squadron Auxiliary, Port Authorities.The charts are currently available as Lithographically printed paper charts, Electronic Raster Nautical Charts (RNCs), up-to-date paper charts (printed with print on demand technology), and are now offered as Digital Vector Electronic Nautical Charts (ENC).The NOAA RNCs are electronic images of the NOAA paper charts. The NOAA RNCs were productized with a successful Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with private sector partner BSB Electronic Charts, a subsidiary of Maptech, Inc. Andover, Massachusetts. As of November 1, 2005 the NOAA RNC's are available for free download via the NOAA website.",

    "title": "The National Artificial Intelligence Research And Development Strategic Plan",
    "description": "Executive Summary: Artificial intelligence (AI) is a transformative technology that holds promise for tremendous societal and economic benefit. AI has the potential to revolutionize how we live, work, learn, discover, and communicate. AI research can further our national priorities, including increased economic prosperity, improved educational opportunities and quality of life, and enhanced national and homeland security. Because of these potential benefits, the U.S. government has invested in AI research for many years. Yet, as with any significant technology in which the Federal government has interest, there are not only tremendous opportunities but also a number of considerations that must be taken into account in guiding the overall direction of Federally-funded R&D in AI. On May 3, 2016,the Administration announced the formation of a new NSTC Subcommittee on Machine Learning and Artificial intelligence, to help coordinate Federal activity in AI.1 This Subcommittee, on June 15, 2016, directed the Subcommittee on Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) to create a National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan. A NITRD Task Force on Artificial Intelligence was then formed to define the Federal strategic priorities for AI R&D, with particular attention on areas that industry is unlikely to address. This National Artificial Intelligence R&D Strategic Plan establishes a set of objectives for Federallyfunded AI research, both research occurring within the government as well as Federally-funded research occurring outside of government, such as in academia. The ultimate goal of this research is to produce new AI knowledge and technologies that provide a range of positive benefits to society, while minimizing the negative impacts. To achieve this goal, this AI R&D Strategic Plan identifies the following priorities for Federally-funded AI research: Strategy 1: Make long-term investments in AI research. Prioritize investments in the next generation of AI that will drive discovery and insight and enable the United States to remain a world leader in AI. Strategy 2: Develop effective methods for human-AI collaboration. Rather than replace humans, most AI systems will collaborate with humans to achieve optimal performance. Research is needed to create effective interactions between humans and AI systems. Strategy 3: Understand and address the ethical, legal, and societal implications of AI. We expect AI technologies to behave according to the formal and informal norms to which we hold our fellow humans. Research is needed to understand the ethical, legal, and social implications of AI, and to develop methods for designing AI systems that align with ethical, legal, and societal goals. Strategy 4: Ensure the safety and security of AI systems. Before AI systems are in widespread use, assurance is needed that the systems will operate safely and securely, in a controlled, well-defined, and well-understood manner. Further progress in research is needed to address this challenge of creating AI systems that are reliable, dependable, and trustworthy. Strategy 5: Develop shared public datasets and environments for AI training and testing. The depth, quality, and accuracy of training datasets and resources significantly affect AI performance. Researchers need to develop high quality datasets and environments and enable responsible access to high-quality datasets as well as to testing and training resources. Strategy 6: Measure and evaluate AI technologies through standards and benchmarks. . Essential to advancements in AI are standards, benchmarks, testbeds, and community engagement that guide and evaluate progress in AI. Additional research is needed to develop a broad spectrum of evaluative techniques. Strategy 7: Better understand the national AI R&D workforce needs. Advances in AI will require a strong community of AI researchers. An improved understanding of current and future R&D workforce demands in AI is needed to help ensure that sufficient AI experts are available to address the strategic R&D areas outlined in this plan. The AI R&D Strategic Plan closes with two recommendations: Recommendation 1: Develop an AI R&D implementation framework to identify S&T opportunities and support effective coordination of AI R&D investments, consistent with Strategies 1-6 of this plan. Recommendation 2: Study the national landscape for creating and sustaining a healthy AI R&D workforce, consistent with Strategy 7 of this plan.",

    "description": "ASTER is capable of collecting in-track stereo using nadir- and aft-looking near infrared cameras.  Since 2001, these stereo pairs have been used to produce single-scene (60- x 60-kilomenter (km)) digital elevation models (DEM) having vertical (root-mean-squared-error) accuracies generally between 10- and 25-meters (m). \n\nThe methodology used by Japan's Sensor Information Laboratory Corporation (SILC) to produce the ASTER GDEM involves automated processing of the entire ASTER Level-1A archive.  Stereo-correlation is used to produce over one million individual scene-based ASTER DEMs, to which cloud masking is applied to remove cloudy pixels.  All cloud-screened DEMS are stacked and residual bad values and outliers are removed.  Selected data are averaged to create final pixel values, and residual anomalies are corrected before partitioning the data into 1 degree (°) x 1° tiles.\n\nThe ASTER GDEM covers land surfaces between 83°N and 83°S and is comprised of 22,702 tiles.  Tiles that contain at least 0.01% land area are included.  The ASTER GDEM is distributed as Geographic Tagged Image File Format (GeoTIFF) files with geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude).  The data are posted on a  1 arc-second (approximately 30–m at the equator) grid and referenced to the 1984 World Geodetic System (WGS84)/ 1996 Earth Gravitational Model (EGM96) geoid.",

Spanning 50Â°S-50Â°N (and all longitudes) and ranging from 1981 to near-present, CHIRPS incorporates our in-house climatology, CHPclim, 0.05Â° resolution satellite imagery, and in-situ station data to create a gridded rainfall time series for trend analysis and seasonal drought monitoring. Since 1999, USGS and CHC scientists (supported by funding from USAID, NASA, and NOAA) have developed techniques for producing rainfall maps, especially in areas where surface data is sparse. Estimating rainfall variations in space and time is a key aspect of drought early warning and environmental monitoring. See https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201566 .

It is a specific geographic area(s) that contains features essential for the conservation of a threatened or endangered species and that may require special management and protection. Critical habitat may include an area that is not currently occupied by the species but that will be needed for its recovery. An area is designated as critical habitat after the Service publishes a proposed Federal regulation in the Federal Register and receives and considers public comments on the proposal.

    "description": "The Allegheny County 911 center answers and dispatches 911 calls for 111 out of 130 municipalities in Allegheny County. Agencies are dispatched via a computer aided dispatch (CAD) system. This dataset contains dispatched EMS and Fire events from the CAD and includes details about the nature of the emergency.\r\n\r\nTo protect the privacy of callers and prevent sensitive health or other identifying information being revealed, the following steps were taken:\r\n  \r\n* Aggregated event location to census block groups.  \r\n* Aggregated call date/time to quarter and year. \r\n* Shortened call types to remove potentially identifying information. \r\n* Flagged certain call types as containing sensitive health information, such as mental health issues, overdose, etc.  \r\n* Checked frequency of calls with sensitive health information: \r\n    * If the number of calls (in a particular category related to sensitive health information) for a certain quarter/year and census block group was greater than or equal to 5, the call description was included.  \r\n    * If less than 5, the call description was redacted. \r\n\r\nEvents requiring EMS and Fire services will appear in both datasets with a different Call ID. Events requiring two agencies of the same service (e.g. two or more different fire companies responded to a major fire) will only list the primary responder.\r\n\r\nThe call descriptions are based on information provided by the caller. The calls are not later updated with a disposition or correction if the original description was inaccurate. For example, if EMS is dispatched to the scene of a stroke, but the person actually had a heart attack, that record would not be updated later with the correct description. \r\n\r\nA small subset of the CAD data had no call type recorded. These records are preserved with a \"null\" in the Description_Short field. Redacted call types are listed as \"Removed\".\r\n\r\nThe 19 municipalities that dispatch their own EMS, Fire, and/or Police services are called \"ringdown municipalities\". These are subject to change. The list can be found in the Ringdown Municipalities 2019 resource.\r\n\r\n**Due to the size of these tables, you may experience 504 Gateway Timeout errors when trying to download the first two resources below.

    "description": "These rates are the daily secondary market quotation on the most recently auctioned Treasury Bills for each maturity tranche (4-week, 13-week, 26-week, and 52-week) that Treasury currently issues new Bills. Market quotations are obtained at approximately 3:30 PM each business day by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The Bank Discount rate is the rate at which a Bill is quoted in the secondary market and is based on the par value, amount of the discount and a 360-day year. The Coupon Equivalent, also called the Bond Equivalent, or the Investment Yield, is the bill's yield based on the purchase price, discount, and a 365- or 366-day year. The Coupon Equivalent can be used to compare the yield on a discount bill to the yield on a nominal coupon bond that pays semiannual interest.",

EDFacts T1:2010-11 (ed.gov/about/inits/ed/edfacts) annually collects cross-sectional data from states about student participants and staff of Title I, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary Act (ESEA), as amended, at the school, LEA, and state levels. EDFacts T1:2010-11 data were collected using the EDFacts Submission System (ESS), a centralized portal and their submission by states is mandatory and required for benefits. Not submitting the required reports by a state constitutes a failure to comply with law and may have consequences for federal funding to the state. Key statistics produced from EDFacts T1:2010-11 are from 18 data groups with information on Economically Disadvantaged Students, School Poverty Indicator, Public School Choice - Eligible, Public School Choice - Applied for Transfer, Public School Choice - Transferred, Public School Choice - Implementation, Public School Choice - 20% Transportation Reservation, Public School Choice - Funds Spent, SES - Applied to Receive Services, SES - Eligible to Receive Services, SES - Funds Spent, SES - Per Pupil Expenditure, SES - Received Services, Title I Part A Participation, Title I Status, Title I Part A SWP/TAS Participation, Title I TAS Staff Funded (FTE), Title I Part A TAS.

When an inspection results in more than one violation, values for associated fields are repeated for each additional violation record.

Keep in mind that thousands of restaurants start business and go out of business every year; only restaurants in an active status are included in the dataset. \r\nRecords are also included for each restaurant that has applied for a permit but has not yet been inspected and for inspections resulting in no violations. Establishments with inspection date of 1/1/1900 are new establishments that have not yet received an inspection. Restaurants that received no violations are represented by a single row and coded as having no violations using the ACTION field. \r\nBecause this dataset is compiled from several large administrative data systems, it contains some illogical values that could be a result of data entry or transfer errors. Data may also be missing. \r\nThis dataset and the information on the Health Department’s Restaurant Grading website come from the same data source.

    "title": "Age-by-Race Specific Crime Rates, 1965-1985:  [United States]",
    "description": "These data examine the effects on total crime rates of \r\n changes in the demographic composition of the population and changes in \r\n criminality of specific age and race groups. The collection contains \r\n estimates from national data of annual age-by-race specific arrest \r\n rates and crime rates for murder, robbery, and burglary over the \r\n 21-year period 1965-1985. The data address the following questions: (1) \r\n Are the crime rates reported by the Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) data \r\n series valid indicators of national crime trends? (2) How much of the \r\n change between 1965 and 1985 in total crime rates for murder, robbery, \r\n and burglary is attributable to changes in the age and race composition \r\n of the population, and how much is accounted for by changes in crime \r\n rates within age-by-race specific subgroups? (3) What are the effects \r\n of age and race on subgroup crime rates for murder, robbery, and \r\n burglary? (4) What is the effect of time period on subgroup crime rates \r\n for murder, robbery, and burglary? (5) What is the effect of birth \r\n cohort, particularly the effect of the very large (baby-boom) cohorts \r\n following World War II, on subgroup crime rates for murder, robbery, \r\n and burglary? (6) What is the effect of interactions among age, race, \r\n time period, and cohort on subgroup crime rates for murder, robbery, \r\n and burglary? (7) How do patterns of age-by-race specific crime rates \r\n for murder, robbery, and burglary compare for different demographic \r\n subgroups? The variables in this study fall into four categories. The \r\n first category includes variables that define the race-age cohort of \r\n the unit of observation. The values of these variables are directly \r\n available from UCR and include year of observation (from 1965-1985), \r\n age group, and race. The second category of variables were computed \r\n using UCR data pertaining to the first category of variables. These are \r\n period, birth cohort of age group in each year, and average cohort size \r\n for each single age within each single group. The third category \r\n includes variables that describe the annual age-by-race specific arrest \r\n rates for the different crime types. These variables were estimated for \r\n race, age, group, crime type, and year using data directly available \r\n from UCR and population estimates from Census publications. The fourth \r\n category includes variables similar to the third group. Data for \r\n estimating these variables were derived from available UCR data on the \r\n total number of offenses known to the police and total arrests in \r\n combination with the age-by-race specific arrest rates for the \r\ndifferent crime types.",

    "description": "This dataset of U.S. mortality trends since 1900 highlights the differences in age-adjusted death rates and life expectancy at birth by race and sex.\n\nAge-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000) after 1998 are calculated based on the 2000 U.S. standard population. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011–2017 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2010. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years between 2000 and 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published. Data on age-adjusted death rates prior to 1999 are taken from historical data (see References below).\n\nLife expectancy data are available up to 2017. Due to changes in categories of race used in publications, data are not available for the black population consistently before 1968, and not at all before 1960. More information on historical data on age-adjusted death rates is available at https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/mortality/hist293.htm.\n\nSOURCES\n\nCDC/NCHS, National Vital Statistics System, historical data, 1900-1998 (see https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/mortality_historical_data.htm); CDC/NCHS, National Vital Statistics System, mortality data (see http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/deaths.htm); and CDC WONDER (see http://wonder.cdc.gov).\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.

    "description": "The Counties dataset was updated on October 31, 2023 from the United States Census Bureau (USCB) and is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT)/Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) National Transportation Atlas Database (NTAD). This resource is a member of a series. The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. The primary legal divisions of most states are termed counties. In Louisiana, these divisions are known as parishes. In Alaska, which has no counties, the equivalent entities are the organized boroughs, city and boroughs, municipalities, and for the unorganized area, census areas. The latter are delineated cooperatively for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau. In four states (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia), there are one or more incorporated places that are independent of any county organization and thus constitute primary divisions of their states. These incorporated places are known as independent cities and are treated as equivalent entities for purposes of data presentation. The District of Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions, and each area is considered an equivalent entity for purposes of data presentation. The Census Bureau treats the following entities as equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentation: Municipios in Puerto Rico, Districts and Islands in American Samoa, Municipalities in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Islands in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The entire area of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas is covered by counties or equivalent entities. The boundaries for counties and equivalent entities are mostly as of January 1, 2023, as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).",

    "title": "Uniform Crime Reporting Program Data Series",
    "description": "Investigator(s): Federal Bureau of Investigation\r\nSince 1930, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has compiled the Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) to serve as periodic nationwide assessments of reported crimes not available elsewhere in the criminal justice system. With the 1977 data, the title was expanded to Uniform Crime Reporting Program Data. Each year, participating law enforcement agencies contribute reports to the FBI either directly or through their state reporting programs. ICPSR archives the UCR data as five separate components: (1) summary data, (2) county-level data, (3) incident-level data (National Incident-Based Reporting System [NIBRS]), (4) hate crime data, and (5) various, mostly nonrecurring, data collections. Summary data are reported in four types of files: (a) Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest, (b) Property Stolen and Recovered, (c) Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR), and (d) Police Employee (LEOKA) Data (Law Enforcement Officers Killed or Assaulted). The county-level data provide counts of arrests and offenses aggregated to the county level. County populations are also reported. In the late 1970s, new ways to look at crime were studied. The UCR program was subsequently expanded to capture incident-level data with the implementation of the National Incident-Based Reporting System. The NIBRS data focus on various aspects of a crime incident. The gathering of hate crime data by the UCR program was begun in 1990. Hate crimes are defined as crimes that manifest evidence of prejudice based on race, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity. In September 1994, disabilities, both physical and mental, were added to the list. The fifth component of ICPSR's UCR holdings is comprised of various collections, many of which are nonrecurring and prepared by individual researchers. These collections go beyond the scope of the standard UCR collections provided by the FBI, either by including data for a range of years or by focusing on other aspects of analysis.\r\nNACJD has produced resource guides on UCR and on NIBRS data.\r\n\r\n ",

HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nData is self-reported by airlines and is only available at a monthly level\n \n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nData updated quarterly\n \n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nAirport data is seasonal in nature, therefore any comparative analyses should be done on a period-over-period basis (i.e. January 2010 vs. January 2009) as opposed to period-to-period (i.e. January 2010 vs. February 2010). It is also important to note that fact and attribute field relationships are not always 1-to-1. For example, Passenger Counts belonging to United Airlines will appear in multiple attribute fields and are additive, which provides flexibility for the user to derive categorical Passenger Counts as desired.",

The NID was first published in 1975, with a few updates as resources permitted over the next ten years. The Water Resources Development Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-662) authorized USACE to maintain and periodically publish an updated NID, with re-authorization and a dedicated funding source provided under the Water Resources Development Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-3). USACE also began close collaboration with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and state regulatory offices to obtain more accurate and complete information. The National Dam Safety and Security Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-310) and the Dam Safety Act of 2006 reauthorized the National Dam Safety Program and included the maintenance and update of the NID by USACE. More recently, the NID was reauthorized as part of the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 and the Water Resources Development Act of 2018.\nThe NID uses a single point to locate a dam.\n\nThe NID consists of dams meeting at least one of the following criteria;\n1) High hazard potential classification - loss of human life is likely if the dam fails,\n2) Significant hazard potential classification - no probable loss of human life but can cause economic loss, environmental damage, disruption of lifeline facilities, or impact other concerns,\n3) Equal or exceed 25 feet in height and exceed 15 acre-feet in storage,\n4) Equal or exceed 50 acre-feet storage and exceed 6 feet in height.

    "description": "The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system. NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee. For additional information on NHD, go to https://www.usgs.gov/national-hydrography.",

    "title": "Sustainable Materials Management (SMM) - Materials and Waste Management in the United States Key Facts and Figures",
    "description": "Each year the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) produces a report titled Advancing Sustainable Materials Management: Facts and Figures. It includes information on municipal solid waste (MSW) generation and management. The 2018 report provides information on recycled commodity values for MSW, and information on  construction and demolition debris, which is outside of the scope of MSW, but is a significant component of the non-hazardous waste stream. The Facts and Figures report also provides summary information on the benefits of recycling from EPA’s 2020 Recycling Economic Information Report. The Facts and Figures webite includes recent reports (2012 to 2018) as well as historical information on materials in the U.S. municipal waste stream 1960 to 2018 (in tons). The reports for both current and historical waste prevention can be accessed at EPA’s sustainable materials management (SMM) website. The recent Annual Facts and Figures reports are accessible at the following link: https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling. Historical data as well as studies and summary tables related to the Advancing Sustainable Materials Management Report are accessible here: https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/studies-summary-tables-and-data-related.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAn Excel file containing the data from 1960 – 2018 is located here: https://edg.epa.gov/data/PUBLIC/OLEM/Materials_Municipal_Waste_Stream_1960_2018.xlsx. EPA also maintains a list of state and local waste characterization studies (reports are not available for all states). You can search for your state at https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/state-and-local-data-about-materials-waste-and.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t",

    "description": "The 2022 cartographic boundary shapefiles are simplified representations of selected geographic areas from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). These boundary files are specifically designed for small-scale thematic mapping. When possible, generalization is performed with the intent to maintain the hierarchical relationships among geographies and to maintain the alignment of geographies within a file set for a given year. Geographic areas may not align with the same areas from another year. Some geographies are available as nation-based files while others are available only as state-based files.\n\nThe primary legal divisions of most states are termed counties. In Louisiana, these divisions are known as parishes. In Alaska, which has no counties, the equivalent entities are the organized boroughs, city and boroughs, municipalities, and for the unorganized area, census areas. The latter are delineated cooperatively for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau. In four states (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia), there are one or more incorporated places that are independent of any county organization and thus constitute primary divisions of their states. These incorporated places are known as independent cities and are treated as equivalent entities for purposes of data presentation. The District of Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions, and each area is considered an equivalent entity for purposes of data presentation. The Census Bureau treats the following entities as equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentation: Municipios in Puerto Rico, Districts and Islands in American Samoa, Municipalities in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Islands in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The entire area of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas is covered by counties or equivalent entities.\n\nThe generalized boundaries for counties and equivalent entities are based on those as of January 1, 2022, primarily as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).",

    "description": "The National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) is a serially complete collection of meteorological and solar irradiance data sets for the United States and a growing list of international locations for 1998-2023. The NSRDB is updated annually and provides foundational information to support U.S. Department of Energy programs, research, industry and the general public.\n\nThe NSRDB provides time-series data at 30-minute resolution of resource averaged over surface cells of 0.038 degrees in both latitude and longitude, or nominally 4 km in size. Additionally time series data at 5 minutes for the US and 10 minutes for North, Central and South America at 2 km resolution are produced from the next generation of GOES satellites and made available from 2019. The solar radiation values represent the resource available to solar energy systems. The data was created using cloud properties which are generated using the AVHRR Pathfinder Atmospheres-Extended (PATMOS-x) algorithms developed by the University of Wisconsin. Fast all-sky radiation model for solar applications (FARMS) in conjunction with the cloud properties, and aerosol optical depth (AOD) and precipitable water vapor (PWV) from ancillary source are used to estimate solar irradiance (GHI, DNI, and DHI). The Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) is computed for clear skies using the REST2 model. For cloud scenes identified by the cloud mask, FARMS is used to compute GHI and FARMS DNI is used to compute the Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI). The PATMOS-X model uses radiance images in visible and infrared channels from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) series of geostationary weather satellites. Ancillary variables needed to run REST2 and FARMS (e.g., aerosol optical depth, precipitable water vapor, and albedo) are derived from NASA's Modern Era-Retrospective Analysis (MERRA-2) dataset. Temperature and wind speed data are also derived from MERRA-2 and provided for use in NREL's System Advisor Model (SAM) to compute PV generation.",

The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB).  The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.\nThe primary legal divisions of most states are termed counties.  In Louisiana, these divisions are known as parishes.  In Alaska, which has no counties, the equivalent entities are the organized boroughs, city and boroughs, municipalities, and for the unorganized area, census areas.  The latter are delineated cooperatively for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau.  In four states (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia), there are one or more incorporated places that are independent of any county organization and thus constitute primary divisions of their states.  These incorporated places are known as independent cities and are treated as equivalent entities for purposes of data presentation.  The District of Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions, and each area is considered an equivalent entity for purposes of data presentation.  The Census Bureau treats the following entities as equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentation: Municipios in Puerto Rico, Districts and Islands in American Samoa, Municipalities in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Islands in the U.S. Virgin Islands.  The entire area of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas is covered by counties or equivalent entities.\nThe boundaries for counties and equivalent entities are mostly as of January 1, 2023, as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).",

    "title": "NOAA NEXt-Generation RADar (NEXRAD) Products",
    "description": "This dataset consists of Level III weather radar products collected from Next-Generation Radar (NEXRAD) stations located in the contiguous United States, Alaska, Hawaii, U.S. territories and at military base sites. NEXRAD is a network of 160 high-resolution Doppler weather radars operated by the NOAA National Weather Service (NWS), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the U.S. Air Force (USAF). Doppler radars detect atmospheric precipitation and winds, which allow scientists to track and anticipate weather events, such as rain, ice pellets, snow, hail, and tornadoes, as well as some non-weather objects like birds and insects. NEXRAD stations use the Weather Surveillance Radar - 1988, Doppler (WSR-88D) system. This is a 10 cm wavelength (S-Band) radar that operates at a frequency between 2,700 and 3,000 MHz. The radar system operates in two basic modes: a slow-scanning Clear Air Mode (Mode B) for analyzing air movements when there is little or no precipitation activity in the area, and a Precipitation Mode (Mode A) with a faster scan for tracking active weather. The two modes employ nine Volume Coverage Patterns (VCPs) to adequately sample the atmosphere based on weather conditions. A VCP is a series of 360 degree sweeps of the antenna at pre-determined elevation angles and pulse repetition frequencies completed in a specified period of time. The radar scan times 4.5, 5, 6 or 10 minutes depending on the selected VCP. During 2008, the WSR-88D radars were upgraded to produce increased spatial resolution data, called Super Resolution. The earlier Legacy Resolution data provides radar reflectivity at 1.0 degree azimuthal by 1 km range gate resolution to a range of 460 km, and Doppler velocity and spectrum width at 1.0 degree azimuthal by 250 m range gate resolution to a range of 230 km. The upgraded Super Resolution data provides radar reflectivity at 0.5 degree azimuthal by 250 m range gate resolution to a range of 460 km, and Doppler velocity and spectrum width at 0.5 degree azimuthal by 250 m range gate resolution to a range of 300 km. Super resolution makes a compromise of slightly decreased noise reduction for a large gain in resolution. In 2010, the deployment of the Dual Polarization (Dual Pol) capability to NEXRAD sites began with the first operational Dual Pol radar in May 2011. Dual Pol radar capability adds vertical polarization to the previous horizontal radar waves, in order to more accurately discern the return signal. This allows the radar to better distinguish between types of precipitation (e.g., rain, hail and snow), improves rainfall estimates, improves data retrieval in mountainous terrain, and aids in removal of non-weather artifacts. The NEXRAD products are divided in two data processing levels. The lower Level II data are base products at original resolution. Level II data are recorded at all NWS and most USAF and FAA WSR-88D sites. From the Level II quantities, computer processing generates numerous meteorological analysis Level III products. The Level III data consists of reduced resolution, low-bandwidth, base products as well as many derived, post-processed products. Level III products are recorded at most U.S. sites, though non-US sites do not have Level III products. There are over 40 Level III products available from the NCDC. General products for Level III include the base and composite reflectivity, storm relative velocity, vertical integrated liquid, echo tops and VAD wind profile. Precipitation products for Level III include estimated ground accumulated rainfall amounts for one and three hour periods, storm totals, and digital arrays. Estimates are based on reflectivity to rainfall rate (Z-R) relationships. Overlay products for Level III are alphanumeric data that give detailed information on certain parameters for an identified storm cell. These include storm structure, hail index, mesocyclone identification, tornadic vortex signature, and storm tracking information. Radar messages for Level III are sent by the radar site to users in order to know more about the radar status and special product data. NEXRAD data are provided to the NOAA National Climatic Data Center for archiving and dissemination to users. Data coverage varies by station and ranges from May 1992 to 1 day from present. Most stations began observing in the mid-1990s, and most period of records are continuous.",

This dataset is a de-identified summary table of vision and eye health data indicators from NHANES, stratified by all available combinations of age group, race/ethnicity, gender, and risk factor. NHANES is a program of studies conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics at CDC designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the U.S, and combines interviews and physical examinations. NHANES stopped collecting vision and eye health data in 2008. Approximate sample size is 5,000 persons per year. NHANES data for VEHSS includes questions and examinations related to Visual Function, Vision Exam Measures, Eye Health Conditions, Service Utilization, and Examination Measures. Data were suppressed for cell sizes less than 30 persons, or where the relative standard error more than 30% of the mean. Detailed information on VEHSS NHANES analyses can be found on the VEHSS NHANES webpage (https://www.cdc.gov/visionhealth/vehss/data/national-surveys/national-health-and-nutrition-examination-survey.html). Additional information about NHANES can be found on the NHANES website (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm). The VEHSS NHANES dataset was last updated in June 2018.",

    "title": "Commercial and Residential Hourly Load Profiles for all TMY3 Locations in the United States",
    "description": "Note: This dataset has been superseded by the dataset found at \"End-Use Load Profiles for the U.S. Building Stock\" (submission 4520; linked in the submission resources), which is a comprehensive and validated representation of hourly load profiles in the U.S. commercial and residential building stock. The End-Use Load Profiles project website includes links to data viewers for this new dataset. For documentation of dataset validation, model calibration, and uncertainty quantification, see Wilson et al. (2022). \n\nThese  data were first created around 2012 as a byproduct of various analyses of solar photovoltaics and solar water heating (see references below for are two examples).  This dataset contains several errors and limitations. It is recommended that users of this dataset transition to the updated version of the dataset posted in the resources.  This dataset contains weather data, commercial load profile data, and residential load profile data.\n\nWeather\nThe Typical Meteorological Year 3 (TMY3) provides one year of hourly data for around 1,000 locations. The TMY weather represents 30-year normals, which are typical weather conditions over a 30-year period.\n\nCommercial\nThe commercial load profiles included are the 16 ASHRAE 90.1-2004 DOE Commercial Prototype Models simulated in all TMY3 locations, with building insulation levels changing based on ASHRAE 90.1-2004 requirements in each climate zone. The folder names within each resource represent the weather station location of the profiles, whereas the file names represent the building type and the representative city for the ASHRAE climate zone that was used to determine code compliance insulation levels. As indicated by the file names, all building models represent construction that complied with the ASHRAE 90.1-2004 building energy code requirements. No older or newer vintages of buildings are represented.\n\nResidential \nThe BASE residential load profiles are five EnergyPlus models (one per climate region) representing 2009 IECC construction single-family detached homes simulated in all TMY3 locations. No older or newer vintages of buildings are represented. Each of the five climate regions include only one heating fuel type; electric heating is only found in the Hot-Humid climate. Air conditioning is not found in the Marine climate region.\n\nOne major issue with the residential profiles is that for each of the five climate zones, certain location-specific algorithms from one city were applied to entire climate zones. For example, in the Hot-Humid files, the heating season calculated for Tampa, FL (December 1 - March 31) was unknowingly applied to all other locations in the Hot-Humid zone, which restricts heating operation outside of those days (for example, heating is disabled in Dallas, TX during cold weather in November). This causes the heating energy to be artificially low in colder parts of that climate zone, and conversely the cooling season restriction leads to artificially low cooling energy use in hotter parts of each climate zone. Additionally, the ground temperatures for the representative city were used across the entire climate zone. This affects water heating energy use (because inlet cold water temperature depends on ground temperature) and heating/cooling energy use (because of ground heat transfer through foundation walls and floors). Representative cities were Tampa, FL (Hot-Humid), El Paso, TX (Mixed-Dry/Hot-Dry), Memphis, TN (Mixed-Humid), Arcata, CA (Marine), and Billings, MT (Cold/Very-Cold).\n\nThe residential dataset includes a HIGH building load profile that was intended to provide a rough approximation of older home vintages, but it combines poor thermal insulation with larger house size, tighter thermostat setpoints, and less efficient HVAC equipment. Conversely, the LOW building combines excellent thermal insulation with smaller house size, wider thermostat setpoints, and more efficient HVAC equipment. However, it is not known how well these HIGH and LOW permutations represent the range of energy use in the housing stock.\n \nNote that on July 2nd, 2013, the Residential High and Low load files were updated from 366 days in a year for leap years to the more general 365 days in a normal year. The archived residential load data is included from prior to this date.",

The primary purpose of this database is to improve the quality of care for Veterans undergoing surgery by providing information to care provider teams for self-assessment and quality improvement purposes. Data for the VASQIP database are entered by nurse data managers using Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) at the VA surgical facilities. These data captured in VistA are securely transmitted to the VASQIP database for compilation and analysis. Results of the data analysis are reported from the National Surgery Office (NSO) for quarterly and annual review of surgical quality and patient care issues; these data are confidential and privileged under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 5705 and its implementing regulations. Note: In 2009, the Cardiac Specialty program (Continuous Improvement in Cardiac Surgery Program (CICSP)) was merged with the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) for a comprehensive all-specialty surgical database, VASQIP.  It employs both Microsoft SQL Server and Statistical Analysis Software implementation.</p>",

Ayers,\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\"HOLC staff members, using data and evaluations organized by local real estate professionals--lenders, developers, and real estate appraisers--in each city, assigned grades to residential neighborhoods that reflected their \"mortgage security\" that would then be visualized on color-coded maps. Neighborhoods receiving the highest grade of \"A\"--colored green on the maps--were deemed minimal risks for banks and other mortgage lenders when they were determining who should received loans and which areas in the city were safe investments. Those receiving the lowest grade of \"D,\" colored red, were considered \"hazardous.\"  <br>\r\n\r\nConservative, responsible lenders, in HOLC judgment, would \"refuse to make loans in these areas [or] only on a conservative basis.\" HOLC created area descriptions to help to organize the data they used to assign the grades. Among that information was the neighborhood's quality of housing, the recent history of sale and rent values, and, crucially, the racial and ethnic identity and class of residents that served as the basis of the neighborhood's grade. These maps and their accompanying documentation helped set the rules for nearly a century of real estate practice. \" \r\n<br>\r\n\r\nHOLC agents grading cities through this program largely \"adopted a consistently white, elite standpoint or perspective. HOLC assumed and insisted that the residency of African Americans and immigrants, as well as working-class whites, compromised the values of homes and the security of mortgages. In this they followed the guidelines set forth by Frederick Babcock, the central figure in early twentieth-century real estate appraisal standards, in his Underwriting Manual: \"The infiltration of inharmonious racial groups ... tend to lower the levels of land values and to lessen the desirability of residential areas.\"   <br>\r\n\r\nThese grades were a tool for redlining: making it difficult or impossible for people in certain areas to access mortgage financing and thus become homeowners. Redlining directed both public and private capital to native-born white families and away from African American and immigrant families. As homeownership was arguably the most significant means of intergenerational wealth building in the United States in the twentieth century, these redlining practices from eight decades ago had long-term effects in creating wealth inequalities that we still see today. Mapping Inequality, we hope, will allow and encourage you to grapple with this history of government policies contributing to inequality.\"  \r\n<br>\r\n\r\nData was copied from the Mapping Inequality Website for communities in Western Pennsylvania where data was available. These  communities include Altoona, Erie, Johnstown, Pittsburgh, and New Castle. Data included original and georectified images, scans of the neighborhood descriptions, and digital map layers. Data here was downloaded on June 9, 2020.",

    "title": "NCHS - Injury Mortality: United States",
    "description": "This dataset describes injury mortality in the United States beginning in 1999. Two concepts are included in the circumstances of an injury death: intent of injury and mechanism of injury. Intent of injury describes whether the injury was inflicted purposefully (intentional injury) and, if purposeful, whether the injury was self-inflicted (suicide or self-harm) or inflicted by another person (homicide). Injuries that were not purposefully inflicted are considered unintentional (accidental) injuries. Mechanism of injury describes the source of the energy transfer that resulted in physical or physiological harm to the body. Examples of mechanisms of injury include falls, motor vehicle traffic crashes, burns, poisonings, and drownings (1,2). \r\n\r\nData are based on information from all resident death certificates filed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Age-adjusted death rates (per 100,000 standard population) are based on the 2000 U.S. standard population. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011–2015 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2010. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for non-census years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.\r\n\r\nCauses of injury death are classified by the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD–10). Categories of injury intent and injury mechanism generally follow the categories in the external-cause-of-injury mortality matrix (1,2). Cause-of-death statistics are based on the underlying cause of death.\r\n\r\nSOURCES\r\n\r\nCDC/NCHS, National Vital Statistics System, mortality data (see http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/deaths.htm); and CDC WONDER (see http://wonder.cdc.gov).\r\n\r\nREFERENCES \r\n\r\n1.

    "title": "Fireball And Bolide Reports",
    "description": "Fireballs and bolides are astronomical terms for exceptionally bright meteors that are spectacular enough to to be seen over a very wide area. The following table provides a chronological data summary of fireball and bolide events provided by U.S. Government sensors. Ground-based observers sometimes also witness these events at night, or much more rarely in daylight, as impressive atmospheric light displays. This website is not meant to be a complete list of all fireball events. Only the brightest fireballs are noted.\r\n\r\nA meteoroid is generally defined as an asteroid or comet fragment that orbits the Sun and has an approximate size between ten microns and a meter or so. Meteors, or \"shooting stars,\" are the visible paths of meteoroids that have entered the Earth's atmosphere at high velocities. A fireball is an unusually bright meteor that reaches a visual magnitude of -3 or brighter when seen at the observer's zenith. Objects causing fireball events can exceed one meter in size. Fireballs that explode in the atmosphere are technically referred to as bolides although the terms fireballs and bolides are often used interchangeably.\r\n\r\nDuring the atmospheric entry phase, an impacting object is both slowed and heated by atmospheric friction. In front of it, a bow shock develops where atmospheric gases are compressed and heated. Some of this energy is radiated to the object causing it to ablate, and in most cases, to break apart. Fragmentation increases the amount of atmosphere intercepted and so enhances ablation and atmospheric braking. The object catastrophically disrupts when the force from the unequal pressures on the front and back sides exceeds its tensile strength.\r\n\r\nObjects causing fireballs are usually not large enough to survive passage through the Earth's atmosphere intact, although fragments, or meteorites, are sometimes recovered on the ground. The approximate total radiated energy in the atmosphere is provided in unit of Joules, a unit of energy given in kilograms times velocity squared, or kg x (m/s)2. An event with an energy equivalent of one thousand tons of TNT explosives is termed a kiloton (kt) event, where 1 kt = 4.185 x 1012 Joules. In the accompanying table, the total radiated energy is given but this is always less that the total impact energy. Peter Brown and colleagues have provided an empirical expression to approximately provide the total impact energy in kt (E), given the optical radiant energy in kt (Eo) (see: Brown et al., The flux of small near-Earth objects colliding with the Earth. Nature, vol. 420, 21 Nov. 2002, pp. 294-296).\r\n\r\nE = 8.2508 x Eo0.885\r\n\r\nThe accompanying table provides information on the date and time of each fireball event, its geographic location, its altitude and velocity at peak brightness, its approximate total optical radiated energy and its calculated total impact energy. The pre-impact velocity components are expressed in a geocentric Earth-fixed reference frame defined as follows: the z-axis is directed along the Earth's rotation axis towards the celestial north pole, the x-axis lies in the Earth's equatorial plane, directed towards the prime meridian, and the y-axis completes the right-handed coordinate system.\r\n\r\nhttp://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/fireball/",

    "description": "This dataset contains the historical estimated congestion for over 1,000 traffic segments, starting 6/11/2024 (except for a single time slice on 3/8/2024). Older records are in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/sxs8-h27x. The most recent estimates for each segment are in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/n4j6-wkkf.\n\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago’s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials.\n\nCongestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O’Hare airport area). There is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes.\n\nThe segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.",

Two days of 24-hour dietary recall data are collected through an initial in-person interview, and a second interview conducted over the telephone within three to 10 days. Participants are given three-dimensional models (measuring cups and spoons, a ruler, and two household spoons) and/or USDA's Food Model Booklet (containing drawings of various sizes of glasses, mugs, bowls, mounds, circles, and other measures) to estimate food amounts. WWEIA data are collected using USDA's dietary data collection instrument, the Automated Multiple-Pass Method (AMPM). The AMPM is a fully computerized method for collecting 24-hour dietary recalls either in-person or by telephone. </p>\n<p>For each 2-year data release cycle, the following dietary intake data files are available:</p>\n<ul><strong>Individual Foods File</strong> - Contains one record per food for each survey participant. Foods are identified by USDA food codes. Each record contains information about when and where the food was consumed, whether the food was eaten in combination with other foods, amount eaten, and amounts of nutrients provided by the food.</ul> \n<ul><strong>Total Nutrient Intakes File</strong> - Contains one record per day for each survey participant. Each record contains daily totals of food energy and nutrient intakes, daily intake of water, intake day of week, total number foods reported, and whether intake was usual, much more than usual or much less than usual. The Day 1 file also includes salt use in cooking and at the table; whether on a diet to lose weight or for other health-related reason and type of diet; and frequency of fish and shellfish consumption (examinees one year or older, Day 1 file only).</ul>\n<p>DHHS is responsible for the sample design and data collection, and USDA is responsible for the survey’s dietary data collection methodology, maintenance of the databases used to code and process the data, and data review and processing.

    "description": "The rural-urban commuting area codes (RUCA) classify U.S. census tracts using measures of urbanization, population density, and daily commuting from the decennial census.\r\n\r\nThe most recent RUCA codes are based on data from the 2000 decennial census. The classification contains two levels. Whole numbers (1-10) delineate metropolitan, micropolitan, small town, and rural commuting areas based on the size and direction of the primary (largest) commuting flows. These 10 codes are further subdivided to permit stricter or looser delimitation of commuting areas, based on secondary (second largest) commuting flows. The approach errs in the direction of more codes, providing flexibility in combining levels to meet varying definitional needs and preferences.\r\n \r\nThe 1990 codes are similarly defined. However, the Census Bureau's methods of defining urban cores and clusters changed between the two censuses. And, census tracts changed in number and shapes. The 2000 rural-urban commuting codes are not directly comparable with the 1990 codes because of these differences.\r\n \r\nAn update of the Rural-Urban Commuting Area Codes is planned for late 2013.",

    "description": "Data sets consists of multiple multivariate time series. Each data set is further divided into training and test subsets. Each time series is from a different engine i.e., the data can be considered to be from a fleet of engines of the same type. Each engine starts with different degrees of initial wear and manufacturing variation which is unknown to the user. This wear and variation is considered normal, i.e., it is not considered a fault condition. There are three operational settings that have a substantial effect on engine performance. These settings are also included in the data. The data is contaminated with sensor noise.\n\nThe engine is operating normally at the start of each time series, and develops a fault at some point during the series. In the training set, the fault grows in magnitude until system failure. In the test set, the time series ends some time prior to system failure. The objective of the competition is to predict the number of remaining operational cycles before failure in the test set, i.e., the number of operational cycles after the last cycle that the engine will continue to operate. Also provided a vector of true Remaining Useful Life (RUL) values for the test data.\n\nThe data are provided as a zip-compressed text file with 26 columns of numbers, separated by spaces. Each row is a snapshot of data taken during a single operational cycle, each column is a different variable. The columns correspond to:\n1)            unit number\n2)            time, in cycles\n3)            operational setting 1\n4)            operational setting 2\n5)            operational setting 3\n6)            sensor measurement  1\n7)            sensor measurement  2\n...\n26)          sensor measurement  26\n \nData Set: FD001\nTrain trjectories: 100\nTest trajectories: 100\nConditions: ONE (Sea Level)\nFault Modes: ONE (HPC Degradation)\n \nData Set: FD002\nTrain trjectories: 260\nTest trajectories: 259\nConditions: SIX\nFault Modes: ONE (HPC Degradation)\n\nData Set: FD003\nTrain trjectories: 100\nTest trajectories: 100\nConditions: ONE (Sea Level)\nFault Modes: TWO (HPC Degradation, Fan Degradation)\n\nData Set: FD004\nTrain trjectories: 248\nTest trajectories: 249\nConditions: SIX\nFault Modes: TWO (HPC Degradation, Fan Degradation)\n\nReference: A.

    "description": "U.S. 15 Minute Precipitation Data is digital data set DSI-3260, archived at the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC). This is precipitation data. The primary source of data for this file is approximately 2,000 mostly U.S. weather stations operated or managed by the U.S. National Weather Service. Stations are primary, secondary, or cooperative observer sites that have the capability to measure precipitation at 15 minute intervals. This dataset contains 15-minute precipitation data (reported 4 times per hour, if precip occurs) for U.S. stations along with selected non-U.S. stations in U.S. territories and associated nations. It includes major city locations and many small town locations. Daily total precipitation is also included as part of the data record. NCDC has in archive data from most states as far back as 1970 or 1971, and continuing to the present day. The major parameter is precipitation amounts at 15 minute intervals, when precipitation actually occurs.",

School districts are special-purpose governments and administrative units designed by state and local officials to provide public education for local residents. District boundaries are collected for NCES by the U.S. Census Bureau to develop demographic estimates and to support educational research and program administration. The NCES Common Core of Data (CCD) program is an annual collection of basic administrative characteristics for all public schools, school districts, and state education agencies in the United States. These characteristics are reported by state education officials and include directory information, number of students, number of teachers, grade span, and other conditions. The administrative attributes in this layer were developed from the most current CCD collection available.

The table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity. Ten percent of all deaths in young California adults aged 15-44 years are related to assault and homicide. In 2010, California law enforcement agencies reported 1,809 murders, 8,331 rapes, and over 95,000 aggravated assaults. African Americans in California are 11 times more likely to die of assault and homicide than Whites.

Measles data for week 52 (in Table 1v) were updated on 02-28-2020 to correct the classification of imported and indigenous. Please see week 52, 2019 data for the correct breakout of imported and indigenous measles cases.\n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published — CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\nMax: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \n† Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).\n\n§ Measles is considered imported if the disease was acquired outside of the United States and is considered indigenous if the disease was acquired anywhere within the United States or it is not known where the disease was acquired.",

    "title": "Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP)",
    "description": "The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellites collect visible and infrared cloud imagery as well as monitoring the atmospheric, oceanographic, hydrologic, cryospheric and near-Earth space environments. The DMSP program maintains a constellation of sun-synchronous, near-polar orbiting satellites. The orbital period is 101 minutes and inclination is 99 degrees. The atmospheric and oceanographic sensors record radiances at visible, infrared and microwave wavelengths. The solar geophysical sensors measure ionospheric plasma fluxes, densities, temperatures and velocities. DMSP visible and infrared imagery of clouds covers a 3,000 km swath, thus each satellite provides global coverage of both day night time conditions each day. The field view of the microwave imagers and sounders is only 1,500 km thus approximately 3 days data are required for one instrument to provide global coverage at equatorial latitudes. The solar geophysical instruments make in-situ measurements of ionospheric parameters, some of which vary very rapidly. The NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (formerly National Geophysical Data Center) receive the complete DMSP data stream from the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA), Offutt Air Force Base, Omaha, Nebraska. Data are currently transmitted in near realtime from AFWA directly to the archive via a designated T1 line. Archive processing prepares orbital data sets of calibrated, quality assessed data organized as a time-series, restores data lost during transmission,and accurately computes satellite positions. NCEI maintains an archive of all data recorded on DMSP satellites as relayed to The NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (formerly National Geophysical Data Center) by the Air Force Weather Agency. Data from March 1992 to March 1994, are considered to be experimental. After March 1994, the system was fully operational. NCEI archives contain data that are post process reconstructed, positioned and geolocated using the same software.",

Special thanks to the community members who participated in reviews with MPD Officers and IT staff, and those who joined us for the #SaferStrongerSmarterDC roundtable design review. All statistics presented in Crime Cards are based on preliminary DC Index crime data reported from 2009 to midnight of today’s date. They are compiled based on the date the offense was reported (Report Date) to MPD. The application displays two main crime categories: Violent Crime and Property Crime. Violent Crimes include homicide, sex abuse, assault with a dangerous weapon (ADW), and robbery. Violent crimes can be further searched by the weapon used. Property Crimes include burglary, motor vehicle theft, theft from vehicle, theft (other), and arson.</div><div><br /></div><div>CrimeCards collaboration between the <a href='https://mpdc.dc.gov' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>Metropolitan Police Department (MPD)</a>, the <a href='https://octo.dc.gov' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO)</a>, and community members who participated at the <a href='https://twitter.com/hashtag/SaferStrongerSmarterDC' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>#SafterStrongerSmarterDC</a> roundtable design review.<br /></div><div><br /></div>",

The Fair Housing Act prohibits most discrimination in housing transactions based on federally recognized bases (race, religion, familial status, etc.)  Cases are investigated by the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO) within the Department of Housing and Urban Development or by state or local government agencies (FHAP agencies) who partner with FHEO to investigate these complaints.  Cases may be conciliated or settled during the investigation process, or there may be reasons why a case needs to be administratively closed, or else the investigation will determine whether there was cause to believe discrimination occurred.  If there is cause to believe discrimination occurred, the case will go through a legal adjudication process to be resolved.",

The 2022 - 2024 NHCS are not yet fully operational so it is important to note that the data presented here are preliminary and not nationally representative.\n\nThe data are from 24 hospitals submitting inpatient and 23 hospitals submitting ED Uniform Bill (UB)-04 administrative claims from October 1, 2022–September 30, 2024. Even though the data are not nationally representative, they can provide insight into the use of opioids and other overdose drugs. The NHCS data is submitted from various types of hospitals (e.g., general/acute, children’s, etc.) and can show results from a variety of indicators related to drug use, such as overall drug use, comorbidities, and drug and polydrug overdose. NHCS data can also be used to report on patient conditions within the hospital over time.",

    "title": "2020 Census Tracts",
    "description": "This data layer is an element of the Oregon GIS Framework. The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB).  The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.\n\nCensus tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and were defined by local participants as part of the 2020 Census Participant Statistical Areas Program.  The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined to participate.  The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses.  Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people.  When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions.  The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement.  Physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions.  In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline.  Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features.  They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some States and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses.  State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy.  In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas.  These noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves noncontiguous.  For the 2010 Census and beyond, the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced for census tracts that include a majority American Indian population according to Census 2000 data and/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized American Indian reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands; the code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for those census tracts that contained little or no population and represented a relatively large special land use area such as a National Park, military installation, or a business/industrial park; and the code range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for those census tracts that contained only water area, no land area.",

The header contains information that pertains to the entire PO/Contract. This includes, but is not limited to,  the total amount of the PO/Contract, the department requesting the purchase and the vendor providing the goods or services. The detail item(s) contain information that is specific to the individual item ordered or service procured through the PO/Contract. The item/service description, item/service quantity and the cost of the item is located within the PO/Contract details. There may be one or many detail items on an individual PO/Contract. For example, a Purchase Order for a computer equipment may include three items: the computer, the monitor and the base software package.\r\n\r\nBoth header information and detail item information are included in this dataset in order to provide a comprehensive view of the PO/Contract data. The Record Type field indicates whether the record is a header record (H) or detail item record (D). In the computer purchase example from above, the system would display 4 records – one header record and 3 detail item records.  \r\n\r\nIt should be noted header information will be duplicated on all detail items. No detail item information will be displayed on the header record.   \r\n\r\n***In October of 2017, the City-Parish switched to a new system used to track PO/Contracts.  This data contains all PO/Contracts entered in or after October 2017.

    "description": "The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) is the codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. It is divided into 50 titles that represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each print volume of the CFR is updated once each calendar year, and is issued on a quarterly basis. Bulk data downloads of Code of Federal Regulations files in XML format are available from 1996 to the present, by year, title, and volume. The current XML data set is not yet an official format of the Code of Federal Regulations. Only the PDF and Text versions have legal status as parts of the official online format of the Code of Federal Regulations. The XML-structured files are derived from SGML-tagged data and printing codes, which may produce anomalies in display. In addition, the XML data does not yet include image files. Users who require a higher level of assurance may wish to consult the official version of the Code of Federal Regulations on Govinfo.gov. The FDsys data set includes digitally signed Code of Federal Regulations PDF files, which may be relied upon as evidence in a court of law. See: https://www.govinfo.gov/app/collection/cfr/",

Claim boundaries, as staked and monumented, are found in the accepted Notice/Certificate of Location as part of the official case file, managed by the BLM State Office having jurisdiction over the claim.The geometries are created in multiple ways but are primarily derived from Legal Land Descriptions (LLD) for the case and geocoded (mapped) using the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) derived from the most accurate survey data available through BLM Cadastral Survey workforce. Geospatial representations might be missing for some cases that can not be geocoded using the MLRS algorithm. <div> Each case is given a data quality score based on how well it mapped.  These can be lumped into seven groups to provide a simplified way to understand the scores. </div><div><ul><li>Group 1: Direct PLSS Match. Scores “0”, “1”, “2”, “3” should all have a match to the PLSS data. There are slight differences, but the primary expectation is that these match the PLSS. </li><li>Group 2: Calculated PLSS Match. Scores “4”, “4.1”, “5”, “6”, “7” and “8” were generated through a process of creating the geometry that is not a direct capture from the PLSS. They represent a best guess based on the underlining PLSS </li><li>Group 3 – Mapped to Section. Score of “8.1”, “8.2”, “8.3”, “9” and “10” are mapped to the Section for various reasons (refer to log information in data quality field). </li><li>Group 4- Combination of mapped and unmapped areas. Score of 15 represents a case that has some portions that would map and others that do not. </li><li>Group 5 – No NLSDB Geometry, Only Attributes. Scores “11”, “12”, “20”, “21” and “22” do not have a match to the PLSS and no geometry is in the NLSDB, and only attributes exist in the data. </li><li>Group 6 – Mapped to County. Scores of “25” map to the County. </li><li>Group 7 – Improved Geometry. Scores of “100” are cases that have had their geometry edited by BLM staff using ArcGIS Pro or MLRS bulk upload tool.</li></ul></div>",

The final release data is published 12-15 months after the initial release of FARS, and could contain additional fatal accidents due to the delay in police reporting, toxicology reports, etc., along with changes to attribute information for previously reported fatal accidents. This file contain elements derived from the FARS datasets to make it easier to extract certain data classifications and topical areas. This file downloaded from the open data catalog is synonymous with what USDOT/NHTSA releases for FARS as the PER_AUX file.  A data dictionary, or other source of attribute information, is accessible at https://doi.org/10.21949/1529022",

    "title": "National Mine Map Repository Mine Locations",
    "description": "The National Mine Map Repository (NMMR) maintains point locations for mines appearing on maps within its archive. This dataset is intended to help connect the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, other federal, state, and local government agencies, private industry, and the general public with archived mine maps in the NMMR's collection. The coordinates for mine point locations represent the best information the NMMR has for the location of the mine. As much as possible, the NMMR strives to find precise locations for all historic mines appearing on mine maps. When this is not possible, another feature as close to the mine as is known is used. This information is reflected in the mine point symbols. However, the NMMR cannot guarantee the accuracy of mine point locations or any other information on or derived from mine maps. The NMMR is part of the United States Department of the Interior, Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE). The mission of the NMMR is to preserve abandoned mine maps, to correlate those maps to the surface topography, and to provide the public with quality map products and services. It serves as a point of reference for maps and other information on surface and underground coal, metal, and non-metal mines from throughout the United States. It also serves as a location to retrieve mine maps in an emergency. Some of the information that can be found in the repository includes: Mine and company names, Mine plans including mains, rooms, and pillars, Man-ways, shafts, and mine surface openings. Geological information such as coal bed names, bed thicknesses, bed depths and elevations, bed outcrops, drill-hole data, cross-sections, stratigraphic columns, and mineral assays. Geographical information including historic railroad lines, roads, coal towns, surface facilities and structures, ponds, streams, and property survey lines, gas well and drill-hole locations. Please note: Map images are not available for download from this dataset. They can be requested by contacting NMMR staff and providing them with the desired Document Numbers. NMMR staff also have additional search capabilities and can fulfill more complex requests if necessary. See the NMMR website homepage for contact information: https://www.osmre.gov/programs/national-mine-map-repository. There is no charge for noncommercial use of the maps. Commercial uses will incur a $46/hour research fee for fulfilling requests.",

    "title": "Global Distribution of Selected Mines, Deposits, and Districts of Critical Minerals",
    "description": "The point and polygon layers within this geodatabase present the global distribution of selected mineral resource features (deposits, mines, districts, mineral regions) for 22 minerals or mineral commodities considered critical to the\neconomy and security of the United States as of 2017. These data complement the report by Schulz and others (2017) which provides national and global information on 23 critical minerals - antimony (Sb), barite (barium, Ba), beryllium (Be), cobalt\n(Co), fluorite or fluorspar (fluorine, F), gallium (Ga), germanium (Ge), graphite (carbon, C), hafnium (Hf), indium (In), lithium (Li), manganese (Mn), niobium (Nb), platinum-group elements (PGE), rare-earth elements (REE), rhenium (Re), selenium\n(Se), tantalum (Ta), tellurium (Te), tin (Sn), titanium (Ti), vanadium (V), and zirconium (Zr) resources. The geospatial locations for deposits containing selenium, which is recovered mainly as a byproduct of other produced mineral commodities, is\nnot included in this geodatabase. These geospatial data and the accompanying report are an update to information published in 1973 in U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 820, United States Mineral Resources. For the current and full discussion\nof the individual critical minerals, their uses, identified resources, national and global distribution, geologic overview, resource assessment, and geoenvironmental considerations see: Schulz, K.J., DeYoung, J.H., Jr., Seal, R.R., II, and Bradley,\nD.C., eds., 2017, Critical mineral resources of the United States—Economic and environmental geology and prospects for future supply: U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 1802, 777 p., https://doi.org/10.3133/pp1802",

    "description": "This feature class represents known electric power substations within the continental US and Puerto Rico that are located within 20 miles of the coastline. Substations are facilities and equipment that switch, transform, or regulate electric voltage. This data set includes taps, a location where power on a transmission line is tapped by another transmission line. Many large rivers and bays hydrologically related to coastal waters were considered part of the coastline to make this data set as detailed and complete as possible. Therefore, applicable substations as far inland as Washington D.C., for example, are included. This data set is currently incomplete; data for Alaska, Hawaii and all of the US sovereign territories (except Puerto Rico) was not available at the time of creation. Although data for Puerto Rico is present, it dates from before the 2017 hurricane season, so the current validity is questionable. This product will be updated as new data becomes available.",

The survey data include information on families balance sheets, pensions, income, and demographic characteristics. Information is also included from related surveys of pension providers and the earlier such surveys conducted by the Federal Reserve Board. No other study for the country collects comparable information. Data from the SCF are widely used, from analysis at the Federal Reserve and other branches of government to scholarly work at the major economic research centers.The survey has contained a panel element over two periods. Respondents to the 1983 survey were re-interviewed in 1986 and 1989. Respondents to the 2007 survey were re-interviewed in 2009.The study is sponsored by the Federal Reserve Board in cooperation with the Department of the Treasury. Since 1992, data have been collected by the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago.",

    "description": "REFPROP is an acronym for REFerence fluid PROPerties. This program, developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), calculates the thermodynamic and transport properties of industrially important fluids and their mixtures. These properties can be displayed in Tables and Plots through the graphical user interface; they are also accessible through spreadsheets or user-written applications accessing the REFPROP dll. REFPROP is based on the most accurate pure fluid and mixture models currently available. It implements three models for the thermodynamic properties of pure fluids: equations of state explicit in Helmholtz energy, the modified Benedict-Webb-Rubin equation of state, and an extended corresponding states (ECS) model. Mixture calculations employ a model that applies mixing rules to the Helmholtz energy of the mixture components; it uses a departure function to account for the departure from ideal mixing. Viscosity and thermal conductivity are modeled with either fluid-specific correlations, an ECS method, or in some cases the friction theory method.",

    "title": "Trips by Distance",
    "description": "Updates are delayed due to technical difficulties.\n\nHow many people are staying at home? How far are people traveling when they don’t stay home? Which states and counties have more people taking trips? The Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) now provides answers to those questions through our new mobility statistics.\n\nThe Trips by Distance data and number of people staying home and not staying home are estimated for the Bureau of Transportation Statistics by the Maryland Transportation Institute and Center for Advanced Transportation Technology Laboratory at the University of Maryland. The travel statistics are produced from an anonymized national panel of mobile device data from multiple sources. All data sources used in the creation of the metrics contain no personal information. Data analysis is conducted at the aggregate national, state, and county levels. A weighting procedure expands the sample of millions of mobile devices, so the results are representative of the entire population in a nation, state, or county. To assure confidentiality and support data quality, no data are reported for a county if it has fewer than 50 devices in the sample on any given day.\n\nTrips are defined as movements that include a stay of longer than 10 minutes at an anonymized location away from home. Home locations are imputed on a weekly basis. A movement with multiple stays of longer than 10 minutes before returning home is counted as multiple trips. Trips capture travel by all modes of transportation. including driving, rail, transit, and air.\n\nThe daily travel estimates are from a mobile device data panel from merged multiple data sources that address the geographic and temporal sample variation issues often observed in a single data source. The merged data panel only includes mobile devices whose anonymized location data meet a set of data quality standards, which further ensures the overall data quality and consistency. The data quality standards consider both temporal frequency and spatial accuracy of anonymized location point observations, temporal coverage and representativeness at the device level, spatial representativeness at the sample and county level, etc. A multi-level weighting method that employs both device and trip-level weights expands the sample to the underlying population at the county and state levels, before travel statistics are computed.\n\nThese data are experimental and may not meet all of our quality standards.  Experimental data products are created using new data sources or methodologies that benefit data users in the absence of other relevant products. We are seeking feedback from data users and stakeholders on the quality and usefulness of these new products. Experimental data products that meet our quality standards and demonstrate sufficient user demand may enter regular production if resources permit.",

This dataset offers a clean, comprehensive view of the City's payroll information by employee.  \n\nAbout the Dataset:\nThis has been extracted from the City of Chicago's Financial Management and Purchasing System (FMPS).  \nFMPS is the system used to process all financial transactions made by the City of Chicago, ensuring accuracy and transparency in fiscal operations.\nThis dataset includes useful details like employee name, pay element, pay period, fund, appropriation, department, and job title. \n-----\nData Disclaimer:\nThe following data disclaimer governs your use of the dataset extracted from the Payroll Costing module of the City of Chicago's Financial Management and Purchasing System (FMPS) or (FMPS Payroll Costing).\n\nPoint-in-Time Extract:\nThe dataset provided herein, represents a point-in-time extract from the FMPS Payroll Costing module and may not reflect real-time or up-to-date data.\n\nFinancial Statement Disclaimer – Timeframe and Limitations:\nThis dataset is provided without audit. It is essential to note that this dataset is not a component of the City's Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR). As such, it remains preliminary and is subject to the end-of-year reconciliation process inherent to the City's annual financial procedures outlined in the ACFR.\n\nNote on Pay Elements:\nAll pay elements available in the FMPS Payroll Costing module have been included in this dataset. \nPreviously published datasets, such as \"Employee Overtime and Supplemental Earnings,\" contained only a subset of these pay elements.\n\nPayroll Period:\nThe dataset's timeframe is organized into 24 payroll periods. It is important to understand that these periods may or may not directly correspond to specific earnings periods.\n\nAggregating Data:\nThe CIty of Chicago often has employees with the same name (including middle initials).  It is vital to use the unique employee identifier code (EMPLOYEE DATASET ID) when aggregating at the employee level to avoid duplication. \n\nData Subject to Change:\nThis dataset is subject to updates and modifications due to the course of business, including activities such as canceling, adjusting, and reissuing checks.\n\nData Disclosure Exemptions:\nInformation disclosed in this dataset is subject to FOIA Exemption Act, 5 ILCS 140/7 (Link:https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/documents/000501400K7.htm)",

    "description": "This data set represents the extent, approximate location and type of wetlands and deepwater habitats in the United States and its Territories. These data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979), which represents a biological definition of wetlands and deepwater habitats. There is no attempt to define the limits of proprietary jurisdiction of any Federal, State, or local government, or to establish the geographical scope of the regulatory programs of government agencies. Some wetland habitats may be under represented or excluded in certain areas because of the limitations of aerial imagery as the primary data source used to detect wetlands. These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters and also some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs). These habitats, because of their depth and water clarity, go undetected by most aerial imagery. By policy, the Service also excludes certain types of \"farmed wetlands\" as may be defined by the Food Security Act or that do not coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition. Contact the Service's Regional Wetland Coordinator for additional information on what types of farmed wetlands are included on wetland maps. This dataset should be used in conjunction with the Wetlands_Project_Metadata layer, which contains project boundaries, specific wetlands mapping procedures and information on dates, scales and emulsion of imagery used to map the wetlands within specific project boundaries.",

The 2022 IMIs were generated using AHRQ Version 2023, while previous years' IMIs were generated with older versions of AHRQ software (2021 IMIs by Version 2022, 2020 IMIs by Version 2021, 2019 IMIs by Version 2020, 2016-2018 IMIs by Version 2019, 2014 and 2015 IMIs by Version 5.0, and 2012 and 2013 IMIs by Version 4.5).  The differences in the statistical method employed and inclusion and exclusion criteria using different versions can lead to different results. Users should not compare trends of mortality rates over time.  However, many hospitals showed consistent performance over years; “better” performing hospitals may perform better and “worse” performing hospitals may perform worse consistently across years. This dataset does not include conditions treated or procedures performed in outpatient settings.

SNAP rules require all recipients meet work requirements unless they are exempt because of age or disability or another specific reason. Children, seniors, and those with disabilities comprise almost two-thirds of all SNAP participants.  Among households that include someone who is able to work, more than 75 percent* had a job  in year before or after receiving SNAP.  Forty-three percent of SNAP participants live in a household with earnings.  \r\n\r\nSome of these working individuals are ABAWDs, or able-bodied adults without dependents.  ABAWDs must meet special work requirements, in addition to the general work requirements, to maintain their eligibility.\r\n\r\nAn ABAWD is a person between the ages of 18 and 49 who has no dependents and is not disabled.  ABAWD stands for Able Bodied Adult Without Dependents.",

    "title": "Allegheny County Mortgage Foreclosure Records",
    "description": "This data includes filings related to mortgage foreclosure in Allegheny County. The foreclosure process enables a lender to take possession of a property due to an owner's failure to make mortgage payments.  Mortgage foreclosure differs from tax foreclosure, which is a process enabling local governments to take possession of a property if the owner fails to pay property taxes.\r\n\r\nAs Pennsylvania is a judicial foreclosure state, a lender files for foreclosure through the court system.  Foreclosure data in the court system is maintained by the Allegheny County Department of Court Records. Data included here is from the general docket, and a  mortgage foreclosure docket created to help homeowners maintain ownership of their property following an initial filing. Several different types of legal filings may occur on a property involved in the foreclosure process. At this time, only the most recent filing in a case is included in the data found here, but we hope to add all filings for a case in the coming months.\r\n\r\nAfter a property enters the foreclosure process, several potential outcomes are possible. Some of the more common outcomes include:  borrowers may come to an agreement with the lender for unpaid debt; borrowers may sell the property to satisfy part or all of the debt; borrowers may voluntarily relinquish ownership to the lender; lenders may decide not to pursue the foreclosure any further; and the property may proceed all the way through a sheriff sale, where it is sold to a new owner.\r\n\r\nBefore September 2022, the data presented here included only the final filing for the month in which each case (represented by Case ID) is opened; since then the feed has changed so we now have a new `last_activity` field, which gets updated whenever there is a new filing in the case with the date of the last filing for the month. The `last_activity` value gives some indication of which cases are still ongoing. (However, the new feed does not include the `docket_type` field, so these are blank for cases started after August 2022.) To view the detailed mortgage foreclosure filings for each property represented in this dataset, please visit the [Department of Court Records Website](https://dcr.alleghenycounty.us/Civil/View/CaseSearchByCaseNumber.aspx), and enter the Case ID for a property to pull-up detailed information about each foreclosure case, including parties, docket entries, and services.\r\n\r\n# Changelog \r\n\r\n2022-12-14: Loaded data back to September (which had been missing due to the schema migration). Added a new `last_activity` field. Data since September 2022 is missing the `docket_type` value, for now those new values will be set to '' (empty string).\r\n\r\n# Visualizations",

    "title": "Interest Rate Statistics - Daily Treasury Yield Curve Rates",
    "description": "These rates are commonly referred to as Constant Maturity Treasury rates, or CMTs. Yields are interpolated by the Treasury from the daily yield curve. This curve, which relates the yield on a security to its time to maturity is based on the closing market bid yields on actively traded Treasury securities in the over-the-counter market. These market yields are calculated from composites of quotations obtained by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The yield values are read from the yield curve at fixed maturities, currently 1, 3 and 6 months and 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, and 30 years. This method provides a yield for a 10 year maturity, for example, even if no outstanding security has exactly 10 years remaining to maturity.",

    "description": "The Trails Layer is designed to provide information about National Forest System trail locations and characteristics to the public. When fully realized, it will describe trail locations, basic characteristics of the trail, and where and when various trail uses are prohibited, allowed and encouraged. Because the data readiness varies between Forests, each Forest will approve which level of attribute subset are published for that forest. Forests can provide no information or one of three attribute subsets describing trails. The attribute subsets include TrailNFS_Centerline which includes the location and trail name and number; TrailNFS_Basic which adds information about basic trail characteristics; and TrailNFS_Mgmt which adds information about where and when users are prohibited, allowed, and encouraged. When a Forest chooses to provide the highest attribute subset, TrailNFS_Mgmt, these attributes must be consistent with the Forest's published Motorized Vehicle Use Map (MVUM). Metadata for the individual Forest feature classes used to compile this feature class are available at data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/dir_trails.php. <a href='https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_USA.TrailNFS_Publish.xml' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'>Metadata</a>",

    "description": "The Average Residential Retail Propane Prices dataset provides New York residents and businesses with objective information on average residential retail propane pricing in New York State and by region beginning September 8, 1997. Pricing data is obtained via surveys conducted by New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) staff on a weekly basis during heating season (September to March) and bi-weekly during the rest of the year. All prices are listed in dollars per gallon.\n\nThe Average Home Heating Oil Prices dataset, Average Residential Retail Kerosene Prices dataset, and Average Residential Retail Propane Prices dataset are collectively referred to as the Heating Fuel Prices dataset.\n\nFor current and historical residential retail price data, regional comparisons, and fuel type comparisons, please visit the Propane Prices Dashboard: https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/researchers-and-policymakers/energy-prices/propane/average-propane-prices\n\nThe New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) offers objective information and analysis, innovative programs, technical expertise, and support to help New Yorkers increase energy efficiency, save money, use renewable energy, and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.

The methodology underlying USEEIO is described in Yang, Ingwersen et al., 2017, with updates for v1.1 described in documentation supporting other USEEIO v1.1 datasets. This dataset is in the form of standard matrices. USEEIOv1.1 uses original names for goods and services, to distinguish them from the sector names provided by BEA which reflect industry names and not commodity names, but the BEA codes are maintained. The main model matrices are in green, A, B, and C; the result matrices are in gold, D, L, LCI, and U. Aggregate data quality scores are presented for B, D and U matrices in peach. Data quality scores use the US EPA data quality asssessment system, see US EPA 2016. Aggregated scores are calculated using a flow-weighted average approach as described in Edelen and Ingwersen 2017. \t\n\nReferences\nBEA (2015).

    "description": "Automatic identification system (AIS) data are used to identify and track vessels for various purposes (primarily navigational safety). These data can be used to study vessel traffic, such as ship routing and speed over ground (SOG). Source data were obtained from the United States Coast Guard Navigation Center (USCG NAVCEN) for the period from June 2008 to December 2015. Derived data resulting from the processing of the source data are described here. This data set presents annual raster data (1 square kilometer grid size) off California from 2008-2015 for cumulative ship traffic density (kilometers/day) and mean SOG (knots; distance-weighted). The universe of data is limited to vessels with a length greater than or equal to 80 meters. The data are analyzed in three groups: freight vessels (container, general cargo, bulk carrier, refrigerated cargo, vehicle carrier, etc.), tanker vessels (crude oil, chemical/products, liquid petroleum gas, etc.) and all vessels (the previously noted vessels, plus passenger vessels and other vessel classes). The data are contained in a file geodatabase format as raster data sets. Metadata for the overall data set are contained at the level of the file geodatabase. The data were generated and used for a research article (Moore et al. 2018):\nMoore, T.J., Redfern, J.V., Carver, M., Hastings, S., Adams, J.D., Silber, G.K., 2018. Exploring Ship Traffic Variability off California.

    "description": "The Corporate Financial Fraud project is a study of company and top-executive characteristics of firms that ultimately violated Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) financial accounting and securities fraud provisions compared to a sample of public companies that did not.  The fraud firm sample was identified through systematic review of SEC accounting enforcement releases from 2005-2010, which included administrative and civil actions, and referrals for criminal prosecution that were identified through mentions in enforcement release, indictments, and news searches.\r\nThe non-fraud firms were randomly selected from among nearly 10,000 US public companies censused and active during at least one year between 2005-2010 in\r\nStandard and Poor's Compustat data.  The Company and Top-Executive (CEO) databases combine information from numerous publicly available sources, many in raw form that were hand-coded (e.g., for fraud firms: Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases (AAER) enforcement releases, investigation summaries, SEC-filed complaints, litigation proceedings and case outcomes).\r\nFinancial and structural information on companies for the year leading up to the financial fraud (or around year 2000 for non-fraud firms) was collected from Compustat financial statement data on Form 10-Ks, and supplemented by hand-collected data from original company 10-Ks, proxy statements, or other financial reports accessed via Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR), SEC's data-gathering search tool.\r\nFor CEOs, data on personal background characteristics were collected from Execucomp and BoardEx databases, supplemented by hand-collection from proxy-statement biographies.",

    "title": "Census Tracts in 2020",
    "description": "<div style='text-align:Left;'><div><div><p><span>Census Tracts from 2020. The TIGER/Line shapefiles are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and were defined by local participants as part of the 2020 Census Participant Statistical Areas Program. The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses. Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline. Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some States and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses. State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy. In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas. These noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves noncontiguous. For the 2020 Census, the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced for census tracts that include a majority American Indian population according to Census 2010 data and/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized American Indian reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands; the code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for those census tracts that contained little or no population and represented a relatively large special land use area such as a National Park, military installation, or a business/industrial park; and the code range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for those census tracts that contained only water area.</span></p></div></div></div>",

The FARS dataset contains descriptions, in standard format, of each fatal crash reported.  To qualify for inclusion, a crash must involve a motor vehicle traveling a traffic-way customarily open to the public and resulting in the death of a person (occupant of a vehicle or a non-motorist) within 30 days of the crash.  Each crash has more than 100 coded data elements that characterize the crash, the vehicles, and the people involved.  The specific data elements may be changed slightly each year to conform to the changing user needs, vehicle characteristics and highway safety emphasis areas.  The type of information that FARS, a major application, processes is therefore motor vehicle crash data.",

The 25 federally-administered states and 16 federally-recognized State Apprenticeship Agencies (SAAs) use the Employment and Training Administration's Registered Apprenticeship Partners Information Database System (RAPIDS) to provide individual apprentice and sponsor data. This subset of data is referred to as RAPIDS data and can be disaggregated to provide additional specificity. The federal subset of that data (25 states plus national programs) is known as the Federal Workload. The remaining federally recognized SAAs and the U.S. Military Apprenticeship Program (USMAP) provide limited aggregate data on a quarterly basis that is then combined with RAPIDS data to provide a national data set on high-level metrics (apprentices and programs) but cannot generally be broken out in greater detail beyond the data provided here.",

    "description": "<p>This dataset includes soil health, crop biomass, and crop yield data for a 13-year corn stover harvest trial in central Iowa. </p>\n<p>Following the release in 2005 of the Billion Ton Study assessment of biofuel sources, several soil health assessments associated with harvesting corn stover were initiated across ARS locations to help provide industry guidelines for sustainable stover harvest. This dataset is from a trial conducted by the National Laboratory for Agriculture and Environment from 2007-2021 at the Iowa State University Ag Engineering and Agronomy farm. Management factors evaluated in the trial included the following.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Stover harvest rate at three levels: No, moderate (3.5 ± 1.1 Mg ha-1 yr-1), or high (5.0 ± 1.7 Mg ha-1 yr-1) stover harvest rates.</li>\n<li>No-till versus chisel-plow tillage. Originally, the 3 stover harvest rates were evaluated in a complete factorial design with tillage system. However, the no-till, no-harvest system performed poorly in continuous corn and was discontinued in 2012 due to lack of producer interest.</li>\n<li>Cropping sequence. In addition to evaluating continuous corn for all stover harvest rates and tillage systems, a corn-alfalfa rotation, and a corn-soybean-wheat rotation with winter cover crops were evaluated in a subset of the tillage and stover harvest rate treatments.</li>\n<li>One-time additions of biochar in 2013 at rates of either 9 Mg/ha or 30 Mg/ha were evaluated in a continuous corn cropping system.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The dataset includes:\n1) Crop biomass and yields for all crop phases in every year.\n2) Soil organic carbon, total carbon, total nitrogen, and pH to 120 cm depth in 2012, 2016, and 2017. Soil cores from 2005 (pre-study) were also sampled to 90 cm depth.\n3) Soil chemistry sampled to 15 cm depth every 1-2 years from 2007 to 2017.\n4) Soil strength and compaction was assessed to 60 cm depth in April 2021.</p>\n<p>These data have been presented in several manuscripts, including Phillips et al.

These estimates are key indicators of local economic conditions.\r\n\r\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) of the U.S. Department of Labor is responsible for the concepts, definitions, technical procedures, validation, and publication of the estimates that State workforce agencies prepare under agreement with BLS.\r\n\r\nEstimates for counties are produced through a building-block approach known as the \"Handbook method.\" This procedure also uses data from several sources, including the CPS, the CES program, state UI systems, and the Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS), to create estimates that are adjusted to the statewide measures of employment and unemployment. Estimates for cities are prepared using disaggregation techniques based on inputs from the ACS, annual population estimates, and current UI data.",

    "description": "Microplastics (i.e., plastics measuring less than 5mm) pollution is a growing problem affecting coastal communities, marine ecosystems, aquatic life, and human health. The widespread occurrence of marine microplastics, and the need to curb its threats, require expansive, and continuous monitoring. While microplastic research has increased in recent years and generated significant volumes of data, there is a lack of a robust, open access, and long-term aggregation of this data. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) marine microplastic data collection provides a global open access to marine microplastic data on an easily discoverable and accessible GIS web map and data portal (https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/microplastics). The objective of this data portal is to develop a repository where microplastics data are aggregated, archived, and served in a user friendly, consistent, and reliable manner. This work contributes to NCEIâs efforts towards data standardization, integration, harmonization, and interoperability among national and international collaborators for monitoring global marine microplastics.",

The National Transit Map (NTM) is a nationwide catalog of fixed-guideway and fixed-route transit service in America. It is compiled using General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) Schedule data. The NTM Stops dataset shows stops where vehicles pick up or drop off riders. This dataset uses the GTFS stops.txt file. The GTFS schedule format and structure documentation is available at, https://gtfs.org/schedule/. To improve the spatial accuracy of the NTM Stops, the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) adjusts transit stops using context from the submitted GTFS source data and/or from other publicly available information about the transit service. A data dictionary, or other source of attribute information, is accessible at https://doi.org/10.21949/1529049</p>",

    "title": "1/3rd arc-second Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) - USGS National Map 3DEP\nDownloadable Data Collection",
    "description": "This is a tiled collection of the 3D Elevation Program (3DEP) and is 1/3 arc-second\n(approximately 10 m) resolution. The 3DEP data holdings serve as the elevation layer of The\nNational Map, and provide foundational elevation information for earth science studies and\nmapping applications in the United States. Scientists and resource managers use 3DEP data\nfor hydrologic modeling, resource monitoring, mapping and visualization, and many other\napplications. The elevations in this DEM represent the topographic bare-earth surface. The\nseamless 1/3 arc-second DEM layers are derived from diverse source data that are processed\nto a common coordinate system and unit of vertical measure. These data are distributed in\ngeographic coordinates in units of decimal degrees, and in conformance with the North\nAmerican Datum of 1983 (NAD 83). All elevation values are in meters and, over the\ncontinental United States, are referenced to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988\n(NAVD88). The seamless 1/3 arc-second DEM layer provides coverage of the conterminous United\nStates, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, other territorial islands, and in limited areas of Alaska. The seamless 1/3arc-second DEM is available as pre-staged current and historical products tiled in GeoTIFF format. The seamless 1/3 arc-second DEM layer is updated continually as new data become available in the current folder. Previously created 1 degree blocks are retained in the historical folder with an appended date suffix (YYYMMDD) when they were produced. Other 3DEP products are nationally\nseamless DEMs in resolutions of 1, and 2 arc seconds. These seamless DEMs were referred to\nas the National Elevation Dataset (NED) from about 2000 through 2015 at which time they\nbecame the seamless DEM layers under the 3DEP program and the NED name and system were\nretired. Other 3DEP products include one-meter DEMs produced exclusively from high\nresolution light detection and ranging (lidar) source data and five-meter DEMs in Alaska as\nwell as various source datasets including the lidar point cloud and interferometric\nsynthetic aperture radar (Ifsar) digital surface models and intensity images. All 3DEP\nproducts are public domain.",

    "description": "This data set includes annual counts and percentages of Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) enrollees by race and ethnicity overall and by three subpopulation topics: scope of Medicaid and CHIP benefits, age group, and eligibility category. \r\nThese results were generated using Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System (T-MSIS) Analytic Files (TAF) Release 1 data and the Race/Ethnicity Imputation Companion File. This data set includes Medicaid and CHIP enrollees in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico who were enrolled for at least one day in the calendar year. Enrollees in Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands are not included. Results shown for the age group and eligibility category subpopulation topics only include enrollees with comprehensive Medicaid and CHIP benefits in the year. Some rows in the data set have a value of \"DS,\" which indicates that data were suppressed according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ Cell Suppression Policy for values between 1 and 10.\r\nThis data set is based on information shown in the brief: \"Race and ethnicity of the national Medicaid and CHIP population in 2020.\" Enrollees are assigned to six race and ethnicity categories using the state-reported race and ethnicity information in TAF when it is available and of good quality; if it is missing or unreliable, race and ethnicity is indirectly estimated using an enhanced version of Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG). Enrollees are assigned to a child (ages 0-18) or adult (ages 19 and older) subpopulation using age as of December 31st of the calendar year. Enrollees are assigned to the comprehensive benefits or limited benefits subpopulation according to the criteria in the \"Identifying Beneficiaries with Full-Scope, Comprehensive, and Limited Benefits in the TAF\" DQ Atlas brief. Enrollees are assigned to an eligibility category subpopulation using their latest reported eligibility group code, CHIP code, and age in the calendar year. Please refer to the full brief for additional context about the methodology and detailed findings. Future updates to this data set will include more recent data years as the TAF data become available.",

The hazards mapping of NGI incorporates a range of data including slope, soil, soil moisture conditions, precipitation, seismicity, and temperature. Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation data at 30 seconds resolution are also incorporated. Hazards values less than or equal to 4 are considered negligible and only values 5 through 9 are utilized in further analyses. To ensure compatibility with other data sets, value 1 is added to each of the values to provide a hazard ranking ranging 6 through 10 in increasing hazard. This data set is the result of collaboration among the Columbia University Center for Hazards and Risk Research (CHRR), Norwegian Geotechnical Institute (NGI), and Columbia University Center for International Earth Science and Information Network (CIESIN).",

    "description": "Global Surface Summary of the Day is derived from The Integrated Surface Hourly (ISH) dataset. The ISH dataset includes global data obtained from the USAF Climatology Center, located in the Federal Climate Complex with NCDC. The latest daily summary data are normally available 1-2 days after the date-time of the observations used in the daily summaries. The online data files begin with 1929 and are at the time of this writing at the Version 8 software level. Over 9000 stations' data are typically available. The daily elements included in the dataset (as available from each station) are: Mean temperature (.1 Fahrenheit) Mean dew point (.1 Fahrenheit) Mean sea level pressure (.1 mb) Mean station pressure (.1 mb) Mean visibility (.1 miles) Mean wind speed (.1 knots) Maximum sustained wind speed (.1 knots) Maximum wind gust (.1 knots) Maximum temperature (.1 Fahrenheit) Minimum temperature (.1 Fahrenheit) Precipitation amount (.01 inches) Snow depth (.1 inches) Indicator for occurrence of: Fog, Rain or Drizzle, Snow or Ice Pellets, Hail, Thunder, Tornado/Funnel Cloud Global summary of day data for 18 surface meteorological elements are derived from the synoptic/hourly observations contained in USAF DATSAV3 Surface data and Federal Climate Complex Integrated Surface Hourly (ISH). Historical data are generally available for 1929 to the present, with data from 1973 to the present being the most complete. For some periods, one or more countries' data may not be available due to data restrictions or communications problems. In deriving the summary of day data, a minimum of 4 observations for the day must be present (allows for stations which report 4 synoptic observations/day). Since the data are converted to constant units (e.g, knots), slight rounding error from the originally reported values may occur (e.g, 9.9 instead of 10.0). The mean daily values described below are based on the hours of operation for the station. For some stations/countries, the visibility will sometimes 'cluster' around a value (such as 10 miles) due to the practice of not reporting visibilities greater than certain distances. The daily extremes and totals--maximum wind gust, precipitation amount, and snow depth--will only appear if the station reports the data sufficiently to provide a valid value. Therefore, these three elements will appear less frequently than other values. Also, these elements are derived from the stations' reports during the day, and may comprise a 24-hour period which includes a portion of the previous day. The data are reported and summarized based on Greenwich Mean Time (GMT, 0000Z - 2359Z) since the original synoptic/hourly data are reported and based on GMT.",

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.\n\nCensus tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and were defined by local participants as part of the 2020 Census Participant Statistical Areas Program.  The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined to participate.  The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses.  Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people.  When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions.  The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement.  Physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions.  In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline.  Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features.  They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some States and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses.  State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy.  In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas.  These noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves noncontiguous.  For the 2010 Census, the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced for census tracts that include a majority American Indian population according to Census 2000 data and/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized American Indian reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands; the code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for those census tracts that contained little or no population and represented a relatively large special land use area such as a National Park, military installation, or a business/industrial park; and the code range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for those census tracts that contained only water area, no land area.",

    "description": "The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB).  The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.\n\n\nZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) are approximate area representations of U.S. Postal Service (USPS) ZIP Code service areas that the Census Bureau creates to present statistical data for each decennial census. The Census Bureau delineates ZCTA boundaries for the United States, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands once each decade following the decennial census. Data users should not use ZCTAs to identify the official USPS ZIP Code for mail delivery. The USPS makes periodic changes to ZIP Codes to support more efficient mail delivery.\n\n\nThe Census Bureau uses tabulation blocks as the basis for defining each ZCTA. Tabulation blocks are assigned to a ZCTA based on the most frequently occurring ZIP Code for the addresses contained within that block. The most frequently occurring ZIP Code also becomes the five-digit numeric code of the ZCTA. These codes may contain leading zeros.\n\n\nBlocks that do not contain addresses but are surrounded by a single ZCTA (enclaves) are assigned to the surrounding ZCTA. Because the Census Bureau only uses the most frequently occurring ZIP Code to assign blocks, a ZCTA may not exist for every USPS ZIP Code. Some ZIP Codes may not have a matching ZCTA because too few addresses were associated with the specific ZIP Code or the ZIP Code was not the most frequently occurring ZIP Code within any of the blocks where it exists. \n\n\nThe ZCTA boundaries in this release are those delineated following the 2010 Census. \n",

    "title": "Airfoil Computational Fluid Dynamics - 2k shapes, 25 AoA's, 3 Re numbers",
    "description": "This dataset contains aerodynamic quantities - including flow field values (momentum, energy, and vorticity) and summary values (coefficients of lift, drag, and momentum) - for 1,830 airfoil shapes computed using the HAM2D CFD (computational fluid dynamics) model. The airfoil shapes were designed using the separable shape tensor parameterization that encodes two-dimensional shapes as elements of the Grassmann manifold. This data-driven approach learns two independent spaces of parameter from a collection of sample airfoils. The first captures large-scale, linear perturbations, and the second defines small-scale, higher-order perturbations. For this dataset, we used the G2Aero database of over 19,000 airfoil shapes to learn a parameter space that captured a wide array of shape characteristics. We sampled airfoil designs over both parameter spaces to explore the full range of possible shape variations.\n\nThe aerodynamic quantities for the generated airfoil were obtained using the HAM2D code, which is a finite-volume Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) flow solver. We employ a fifth-order WENO scheme for spatial reconstruction with Roe's flux difference scheme for inviscid flux and second-order central differencing for viscous flux. A preconditioned GMRES method is applied for implicit integration. The Spalart-Allmaras 1-eq turbulence model is used for the turbulence closure, and the Medida-Baeder 2-eq transition model is applied to account for the effects of laminar turbulent transition. The airfoil grid is generated with a total of 400 points on the airfoil surface, the initial wall-normal spacing of y+ = 1, and an outer boundary located at 300 chord lengths away from the wall. The CFD simulations are performed at a freestream Mach number of 0.1, for or three different Reynolds' numbers (3M, 6M, and 9M), and for 25 angles of attack from -4 deg. to 20 deg. with 1 degree increments. Across all these various parameters, this dataset includes the results from over 250,000 CFD simulations.\n\nThe simulations were performed using the Bridges-2 system at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center in February 2023 as part of the INTEGRATE project funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy, in the U.S. Department of Energy. The data was collected, reformatted, and preprocessed for this OEDI submission in July 2023 under the Foundational AI for Wind Energy project funded by the U.S. Department of Energy Wind Energy Technologies Office. This dataset is intended to serve as a benchmark against which new artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML) tools may be tested. Baseline AI/ML methods for analyzing this dataset have been implemented, and a link to their repository containing those models has been provided.\n\nThe .h5 data file structure can be found in the GitHub Repository resource under explore_airfoil_2k_data.ipynb.",

The June file contains the Annual Salary, and the pay data as of the last pay period in June. *Note that the June file is replaced by the December file each year.*\r\n\r\nUnion contracted salaries and wages which were not settled during the calendar year reflect the wage as of the end of the year. Regular Pay for these positions includes salaries and wages for the year it was paid, not the year it was earned. \r\n\r\nIn addition to salary or wages for days worked and retroactively settled contract payments, Regular Pay also includes pay for days such as holidays, sick days, and vacation days. Overtime Pay includes pay for extra work typically at a wage rate different from regular wages as set forth in a collective bargaining agreement. Incentive Pay includes such things as a wellness incentive and longevity pay.\r\n\r\nEmployee names are included in the dataset with the following exceptions permitted by the Pennsylvania Right to Know Law:\r\n\r\n* The names of individuals who were active sworn law enforcement officers during the year; and\r\n* Information that would disclose individually identifiable health information.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, records related to Court of Common Pleas employees would need to be requested from the [Courts](https://www.alleghenycourts.us/).\r\n\r\n*In March 2022, the salary data files prior to 2021 were updated so that all columns matched for consistent presentation.*",

Some geographies are available as nation-based files while others are available only as state-based files.\n\nThis file depicts the shape of the United States clipped back to a generalized coastline.

As many NWS stations as possible are used, including those from the NWS Cooperative Observer Program (COOP) Network as well as some additional stations that have a Weather Bureau Army-Navy (WBAN) station identification number, including stations from the Climate Reference Network (CRN). THe Annual Climate Normals dataset includes various derived products such as daily air temperature normals (including maximum and minimum temperature normal, heating and cooling degree day normal, and others), precipitation normals (including snowfall and snow depth, percentiles, frequencies and other), and hourly normals (all normal derived from hourly data including temperature, dew point, heat index, wind chill, wind, cloudiness, heating and cooling degree hours, pressure normals). All data utilized in the computation of the 1981-2010 Climate Normals were taken from the ISD Lite (a subset of derived Integrated Surface Data), the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily dataset, and standardized monthly temperature data (COOP). These source datasets (including intermediate datasets used in the computation of products) are also archived at the NOAA NCDC.",

    "description": "The Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD) is a unique and powerful database designed to support various types of analyses of national readmission rates for all payers and the uninsured. The NRD includes discharges for patients with and without repeat hospital visits in a year and those who have died in the hospital. Repeat stays may or may not be related. The criteria to determine the relationship between hospital admissions is left to the analyst using the NRD. This database addresses a large gap in health care data - the lack of nationally representative information on hospital readmissions for all ages.  Outcomes of interest include national readmission rates, reasons for returning to the hospital for care, and the hospital costs for discharges with and without readmissions. Unweighted, the NRD contains data from approximately 18 million discharges each year. Weighted, it estimates roughly 35 million discharges. Developed through a Federal-State-Industry partnership sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, HCUP data inform decision making at the national, State, and community levels. \n\nThe NRD is drawn from HCUP State Inpatient Databases (SID) containing verified patient linkage numbers that can be used to track a person across hospitals within a State, while adhering to strict privacy guidelines.  The NRD is not designed to support regional, State-, or hospital-specific readmission analyses.  \n\nThe NRD contains more than 100 clinical and non-clinical data elements provided in a hospital discharge abstract. Data elements include but are not limited to: diagnoses, procedures, patient demographics (e.g., sex, age), expected source of payer, regardless of expected payer, including but not limited to Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance, self-pay, or those billed as ‘no charge, discharge month, quarter, and year, total charges, length of stay, and data elements essential to readmission analyses.  The NIS excludes data elements that could directly or indirectly identify individuals. \n\nRestricted access data files are available with a data use agreement and brief online security training.",

    "description": "This GIS dataset offers a link to the California portion of the Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) information resource for the United States Geological Survey. The NAS program has been established as a central repository for accurate and spatially referenced biogeographic accounts of nonindigenous aquatic species. The program provides scientic reports, online/realtime queries, spatial data sets, regional contact lists, and general information. The goal of the information system is to provide timely, reliable data about the presence and distribution of nonindigenous aquatic species. The NAS database contains locality information for more than 1100 species of vertebrates, invertebrates, and vascular plants. The NAS program provides a continual national repository of distribution information for nonindigenous aquatic species that is used to gain an understanding of aquatic introductions, identify geographic gaps, and access the status of introduced aquatic species nationwide. Data are obtained from many sources including literature, museums, databases, monitoring programs, state and federal agencies, professional communications, online reporting forms, and Aquatic Nuisance Species (ANS) hotline reports. The NAS program defines a nonindigenous aquatic species as a member(s) of a species that enters a body of water of aquatic ecosystem outside of its historic or native range. This includes not only species that arrived from outside of North America but also species native to North America that have been introduced to drainages outside their ranges within the country. Please visit http://nas.er.usgs.gov for more information and to see all of the products and data available through the NAS program.",

    "description": "This is series-level metadata for the USGS Protected Areas Database of the United States (PAD-US) data released by the United States Geological Survey (USGS).  PAD-US is the nation's inventory of protected areas, including public land and voluntarily provided private protected areas. Starting with version 1.4 PAD-US was identified as an A-16 National Geospatial Data Asset in the Cadastre Theme ( https://ngda-cadastre-geoplatform.hub.arcgis.com/ ). The PAD-US is an ongoing project with several published versions of a spatial database including areas dedicated to the preservation of biological diversity, and other natural (including extraction), recreational, or cultural uses, managed for these purposes through legal or other effective means. The database was originally designed to support biodiversity assessments; however, its scope expanded in recent years to include all open space public and nonprofit lands and waters. Most are public lands owned in fee (the owner of the property has full and irrevocable ownership of the land); however, permanent and long-term easements, leases, agreements, Congressional (e.g. 'Wilderness Area'), Executive (e.g. 'National Monument'), and administrative designations (e.g. 'Area of Critical Environmental Concern') documented in agency management plans are also included. The PAD-US strives to be a complete inventory of U.S. public land and other protected areas, compiling \"best available\" data provided by managing agencies and organizations. The PAD-US geodatabase maps and describes areas using thirty-six attributes and five separate feature classes representing the U.S. protected areas network: Fee (ownership parcels), Designation, Easement, Marine, Proclamation and Other Planning Boundaries. An additional Combined feature class includes the full PAD-US inventory to support data management, queries, web mapping services, and analyses. The Feature Class (FeatClass) field in the Combined layer allows users to extract data types as needed. A Federal Data Reference file geodatabase lookup table facilitates the extraction of authoritative federal data provided or recommended by managing agencies from the Combined PAD-US inventory.\n\nFor more information regarding the PAD-US dataset please visit, https://www.usgs.gov/programs/gap-analysis-project/science/protected-areas/.  For more information about data aggregation please review the PAD-US Data Manual available at https://www.usgs.gov/programs/gap-analysis-project/pad-us-data-manual .\n\nA version history of PAD-US updates is summarized below (See https://www.usgs.gov/programs/gap-analysis-project/pad-us-data-history for more information): \n- Current Version - January 2022 (Version 3.0) https://doi.org/10.5066/P9Q9LQ4B\n- Revised - September 2020 (Version 2.1) https://doi.org/10.5066/P92QM3NT \n- Revised - September 2018 (Version 2.0) https://doi.org/10.5066/P955KPLE\n- Revised - May 2016 (Version 1.4) https://doi.org/10.5066/F7G73BSZ\n- Revised - November 2012 (Version 1.3) https://doi.org/10.5066/F79Z92XD\n- Revised - April 2011 (Version 1.2 - available from the PAD-US: Team pad-us@usgs.gov)\n- Revised - May 2010 (Version 1.1 - available from the PAD-US: Team pad-us@usgs.gov)\n- First posted - April 2009 (Version 1.0 - available from the PAD-US: Team pad-us@usgs.gov)\n \nComparing protected area trends between PAD-US versions is not recommended without consultation with USGS as many changes reflect improvements to agency and organization GIS systems, or conservation and recreation measure classification, rather than actual changes in protected area acquisition on the ground.",

    "title": "Lithium Deposits in the United States",
    "description": "This data release provides the descriptions of approximately 20 U.S. sites that include mineral regions, mines, and mineral occurrences (deposits and prospects) that contain enrichments of lithium (Li). This release includes sites that have a contained resource and (or) past production of lithium metal greater than 15,000 metric tons. Sites in this database occur in Arkansas, California, Nevada, North Carolina, and Utah. There are several deposits that were not included in the database because they did not meet the cutoff requirement, and those occur in Arizona, Colorado, the New England area, New Mexico, South Dakota, and Wyoming.\nIn the United States, lithium was first mined from pegmatite orebodies in South Dakota in the late 1800s. The Kings Mountain pegmatite belt of North Carolina also had significant production from pegmatites, and the area may still contain as much as 750 million metric tons (Mt) of ore containing 5 Mt lithium metal (Kesler and others, 2012). In 2018, U.S. production of lithium was restricted to a single lithium-brine mining operation in Nevada. In 2018, the U.S. had a net import reliance as a percentage of apparent consumption of more than 50 percent for lithium (U.S. Geological Survey, 2019). The U.S. is not a significant producer of lithium, so the commodity is mainly imported from Chile and Argentina to meet consumer demand.\nLithium is necessary for strategic, consumer, and commercial applications. The primary uses for lithium are in batteries, ceramics, glass, metallurgy, pharmaceuticals, and polymers (U.S. Geological Survey, 2019). Lithium has excellent electrical conductivity and low density (lithium metal will float on water), making it an ideal component for battery manufacturing. Lithium is traded in three primary forms: mineral concentrates, mineral compounds (from brines), and refined metal (electrolysis from lithium chloride). \nLithium mineralogy is diverse; it occurs in a variety of pegmatite minerals such as spodumene, lepidolite, amblygonite, and in the clay mineral hectorite. Current global production of lithium is dominated by pegmatite and closed-basin brine deposits, but there are significant resources in lithium-bearing clay minerals, oilfield brines, and geothermal brines (Bradley and others, 2017).\nThe entries and descriptions in the database were derived from published papers, reports, data, and internet documents representing a variety of sources, including geologic and exploration studies described in State, Federal, and industry reports. Resources extracted from older sources might not be compliant with current rules and guidelines in minerals industry standards such as National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101) or the Joint Ore Reserves Committee Code (JORC Code).  The inclusion of a particular lithium mineral deposit in this database is not meant to imply that the deposit is currently economic. Rather, these deposits were included to capture the characteristics of the larger lithium deposits in the United States, which are diverse in their geology and resource potential. Inclusion of material in the database is for descriptive purposes only and does not imply endorsement by the U.S. Government. The authors welcome additional published information in order to continually update and refine this dataset.\nBradley, D.C., Stillings, L.L., Jaskula, B.W., Munk, LeeAnn, and McCauley, A.D., 2017, Lithium, chap.

    "description": "The City-based Optimization Model for Energy Technologies (COMET-NYC) is an energy system modeling tool developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. COMET is applied to New York City to support long-term, metropolitan-scale air, climate, and energy planning. Built on the internationally recognized TIMES modeling framework, COMET-NYC identifies the least-cost mix of technologies and fuels required to meet projected energy demands from 2010 to 2055 across NYC’s buildings, transportation, and electricity sectors.\nCOMET-NYC uses a scenario-based optimization approach to simulate the deployment of energy technologies under various assumptions, policies, and constraints. It incorporates local data sources to estimate and calibrate energy consumption and emissions at the borough level. It tracks both greenhouse gases (GHGs) and criteria air pollutants, supporting city-level climate and air quality policy evaluation.\nThe model includes detailed modules for the residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation sectors, accounting for current and future technology costs, fuel types, and efficiency parameters. It uses linear programming to minimize system-wide costs while meeting energy service demands and emissions targets. COMET-NYC supports both retrospective analysis (e.g., calibration to 2010, 2015, and 2020) and future scenario exploration, such as electrification strategies.\nTwo versions of the model are included in this dataset: v15.0.9, which underpinned emissions reduction planning during the 2023–2024 NYC budgeting cycle, and v16.0.1, which includes updated buildings data and improved calibration.\nThe documentation included various appendices for background data to build COMET-NYC. Appendix A through F are included in this dataset. Appendix A provides time slice documentation; Appendix B provides PLUTO 2010 data; Appendix C provides original 2014 building end-use demand splits for NYC; Appendix D provides EIA 2023 building technology data; APPENDIX E provides 2015 NYMTC SEDS population and employment forecasts; and APPENDIX F provides Documentation of Transportation Sector Emission Factors Updates and related input datasets for MOVES model. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nKaplan, O., Z.

    "title": "Third Generation Simulation Data (TGSIM) I-395 Trajectories",
    "description": "The main dataset is a 232 MB file of trajectory data (I395-final.csv) that contains position, speed, and acceleration data for non-automated passenger cars, trucks, buses, and automated vehicles on an expressway within an urban environment. Supporting files include an aerial reference image (I395_ref_image.png) and a list of polygon boundaries (I395_boundaries.csv) and associated images (I395_lane-1, I395_lane-2, …, I395_lane-6) stored in a folder titled “Annotation on Regions.zip” to map physical roadway segments to the numerical lane IDs referenced in the trajectory dataset. In the boundary file, columns “x1” to “x5” represent the horizontal pixel values in the reference image, with “x1” being the leftmost boundary line and “x5” being the rightmost boundary line, while the column \"y\" represents corresponding vertical pixel values. The origin point of the reference image is located at the top left corner. The dataset defines five lanes with five boundaries. Lane -6 corresponds to the area to the left of “x1”. Lane -5 corresponds to the area between “x1” and “x2”, and so forth to the rightmost lane, which is defined by the area to the right of “x5” (Lane -2). Lane -1 refers to vehicles that go onto the shoulder of the merging lane (Lane -2), which are manually separated by watching the videos.\n\nThis dataset was collected as part of the Third Generation Simulation Data (TGSIM): A Closer Look at the Impacts of Automated Driving Systems on Human Behavior project. During the project, six trajectory datasets capable of characterizing human-automated vehicle interactions under a diverse set of scenarios in highway and city environments were collected and processed. For more information, see the project report found here: https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/74647. This dataset, which was one of the six collected as part of the TGSIM project, contains data collected from six 4K cameras mounted on tripods, positioned on three overpasses along I-395 in Washington, D.C. The cameras captured distinct segments of the highway, and their combined overlapping and non-overlapping footage resulted in a continuous trajectory for the entire section covering 0.5 km. This section covers a major weaving/mandatory lane-changing between L'Enfant Plaza and 4th Street SW, with three lanes in the eastbound direction and a major on-ramp on the left side. In addition to the on-ramp, the section covers an off-ramp on the right side. The expressway includes one diverging lane at the beginning of the section on the right side and one merging lane in the middle of the section on the left side. For the purposes of data extraction, the shoulder of the merging lane is also considered a travel lane since some vehicles illegally use it as an extended on-ramp to pass other drivers (see I395_ref_image.png for details). The cameras captured continuous footage during the morning rush hour (8:30 AM-10:30 AM ET) on a sunny day. During this period, vehicles equipped with SAE Level 2 automation were deployed to travel through the designated section to capture the impact of SAE Level 2-equipped vehicles on adjacent vehicles and their behavior in congested areas, particularly in complex merging sections. These vehicles are indicated in the dataset.\n\nAs part of this dataset, the following files were provided:\n<ul><li>I395-final.csv contains the numerical data to be used for analysis that includes vehicle level trajectory data at every 0.1 second. Vehicle type, width, and length are provided with instantaneous location, speed, and acceleration data. All distance measurements (width, length, location) were converted from pixels to meters using the following conversion factor: 1 pixel = 0.3-meter conversion.</li>\n<li>I395_ref_image.png is the aerial reference image that defines the geographic region and the associated roadway segments.</li>\n<li>I395_boundaries.csv contains the coordinates that define the roadway segments (n=X). The columns \"x1\" to \"x5\" represent the horizontal pi",

Setbacks can be computed either locally (on a per-county basis with specified distances or multipliers) or globally under a generic setback multiplier assumption applied to either the turbine tip height or the base setback distance. A County FIPS code is a five-digit numerical identifier that uniquely identifies counties and county equivalents in the United States The initial two digits represent the FIPS state code, while the final three digits signify the county's unique code within that state. For instance, 55025 corresponds to Dane County, Wisconsin. The first two digits - 55 - represent Wisconsin, and the last three digits - 025 - denote Dane County. Further information can be accessed at the \"Federal Information Processing System (FIPS) Codes for States and Counties\" resource below. ",

Samples were obtained from archived ore collections under the U.S. Geological Survey's project titled Quick Assessment of Rare and Critical Metals in Ore Deposits: A National Assessment (2008 to 2013) in an effort to begin an assessment of the Nations' previously mined ore deposits for critical minerals. Mineralized and altered rock samples were provided by the Colorado School of MinesRansome collection, Mackay School of MinesStanford and Keck collections, and by the personal collections of Don Bryant and David Leach.",

    "title": "Transportation to Work",
    "description": "This table contains data on the percent of residents aged 16 years and older mode of transportation to work for California, its regions, counties, cities/towns, and census tracts. Data is from the U.S. Census Bureau, Decennial Census and American Community Survey. The table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity.  Commute trips to work represent 19% of travel miles in the United States. The predominant mode – the automobile - offers extraordinary personal mobility and independence, but it is also associated with health hazards, such as air pollution, motor vehicle crashes, pedestrian injuries and fatalities, and sedentary lifestyles. Automobile commuting has been linked to stress-related health problems. Active modes of transport – bicycling and walking alone and in combination with public transit – offer opportunities for physical activity, which is associated with lowering rates of heart disease and stroke, diabetes, colon and breast cancer, dementia and depression. Risk of injury and death in collisions are higher in urban areas with more concentrated vehicle and pedestrian activity.  Bus and rail passengers have a lower risk of injury in collisions than motorcyclists, pedestrians, and bicyclists. Minority communities bear a disproportionate share of pedestrian-car fatalities; Native American male pedestrians experience four times the death rate Whites or Asian pedestrians, and African-Americans and Latinos experience twice the rate as Whites or Asians. More information about the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the About/Attachments section.",

Data quality score associated with the EPA DQ system [3] for data reliability and technological correlation are assigned as described in Yang et al. 2017, Supporting Information 1 [4]. This model builds upon the USEEIO v1.1 GHG satellite table [5] and the Yale Center for Industrial Ecology USEEIO extensions v2.1 [6].

Total consumer credit comprises two major types: revolving and nonrevolving. Revolving credit plans may be unsecured or secured by collateral and allow a consumer to borrow up to a prearranged limit and repay the debt in one or more installments. Credit card loans comprise most of revolving consumer credit measured in the G.19, but other types, such as prearranged overdraft plans, are also included. Nonrevolving credit is closed-end credit extended to consumers that is repaid on a prearranged repayment schedule and may be secured or unsecured. To borrow additional funds, the consumer must enter into an additional contract with the lender. Consumer motor vehicle and education loans comprise the majority of nonrevolving credit, but other loan types, such as boat loans, recreational vehicle loans, and personal loans, are also included. This statistical release is designated by OMB as a Principal Federal Economic Indicator (PFEI).",

Single-line drainage water features can be found in the Linear Hydrography Shapefile (LINEARWATER.shp). Linear water features includes single-line drainage water features and artificial path features, where they exist, that run through double-line drainage features such as rivers, streams, and/or canals, and serve as a linear representation of these features.

A proportional allocation gridding algorithm, utilizing approximately 13.5 million national and sub-national administrative Units, was used to assign population counts to 30 arc-second grid cells. The data files were produced as global rasters at 30 arc-second (~1 km at the equator) resolution. To enable faster global processing, and in support of research commUnities, the 30 arc-second data were aggregated to 2.5 arc-minute, 15 arc-minute, 30 arc-minute and 1 degree resolutions.",

Populations used for computing death rates for 2011–2017 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2010. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years between 2000 and 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published. Data on age-adjusted death rates prior to 1999 are taken from historical data (see References below).\n\nAge groups for childhood death rates are based on age at death.\n\nSOURCES\n\nCDC/NCHS, National Vital Statistics System, historical data, 1900-1998 (see https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/mortality_historical_data.htm); CDC/NCHS, National Vital Statistics System, mortality data (see http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/deaths.htm); and CDC WONDER (see http://wonder.cdc.gov).\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.

The DFIRM Database is the digital,\ngeospatial version of the flood hazard information shown on the published paper Flood Insurance Rate\nMaps(FIRMs). The primary risk classifications used are the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event, the\n0.2-percent-annual-chance flood event, and areas of minimal flood risk. The NFHL data are derived\nfrom Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), flood\nhazard analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data where available.\nThe FISs and FIRMs are published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The\nspecifications for the horizontal control of DFIRM data are consistent with those required for\nmapping at a scale of 1:12,000. The NFHL data contain layers in the Standard DFIRM datasets except\nfor S_Label_Pt and S_Label_Ld. The NFHL is available as State or US Territory data sets.

The mission was co-sponsored by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) performed preliminary processing of SRTM data and forwarded partially finished data directly to NGA for finishing by NGA's contractors and subsequent monthly deliveries to the NGA Digital Products Data Wharehouse (DPDW). All the data products delivered by the contractors conform to the NGA SRTM products and the NGA Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED) to the Earth Resources Observation & Science (EROS) Center. The DPDW ingests the SRTM data products, checks them for formatting errors, loads the SRTM DTED into the NGA data distribution system, and ships the public domain SRTM DTED to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation & Science (EROS) Center.   \n\nTwo resolutions of finished grade SRTM data are available through EarthExplorer from the collection held in the USGS EROS archive:\n\n1 arc-second (approximately 30-meter) high resolution elevation data are only available for the United States.\n\n3 arc-second (approximately 90-meter) medium resolution elevation data are available for global coverage. The 3 arc-second data were resampled using cubic convolution interpolation for regions between 60° north and 56° south latitude.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",

    "description": "Killer whales (Orcinus orca) exhibit significant ecological and genetic diversity, with three primary sympatric ecotypes in the Northeast Pacific: Resident, Biggâs (Transient), and Offshore. Each ecotype is adapted to distinct ecological niches, with unique foraging strategies, social structures, and vocal behaviors. These differences underscore the challenges in monitoring and conserving each group, as they coexist within overlapping geographic ranges yet do not intermix. This dataset, compiled from diverse sources, provides a comprehensive resource for the detection and classification of killer whale vocalizations. The >225,000 call-level annotations collected from 23 locations, and a cleaned annotation csv that collates annotations across the different protocols. Recordings spanning eleven years from various geographical locations within the Northeast Pacific Ocean, collected using multiple hydrophone systems. It addresses the challenge of differentiating killer whale calls from other marine species and environmental noise and includes specific instances of confounding signals to enhance model robustness. Detailed annotations capture a broad spectrum of vocalizations and associated metadata, facilitating the development of advanced machine learning models for ecological monitoring. This curated dataset aims to improve the accuracy of killer whale detection algorithms, support conservation efforts, and advance our understanding of killer whale acoustic communication across different ecotypes.",

Boundaries data are useful for\n            understanding the extent of jurisdictional or administrative areas for a wide range of applications, including mapping or\n            managing resources, and responding to natural disasters. Boundaries data also include extents of forest, grassland, park,\n            wilderness, wildlife, and other reserve areas useful for recreational activities, such as hiking and backpacking. Boundaries\n            data are acquired from a variety of government sources. The data represents the source data with minimal editing or review by\n            USGS. Please refer to the feature-level metadata for information on the data source. The National Map boundaries data is\n            commonly combined with other data themes, such as elevation, hydrography, structures, and transportation, to produce general\n            reference base maps.

Because FNDDS is used to generate the nutrient intake data files for WWEIA, NHANES, it is not required to estimate nutrient intakes from the survey. FNDDS is made available for  researchers using WWEIA, NHANES to review the nutrient profiles for specific foods and beverages as well as their associated portions and recipes. Such detailed information makes it possible for researchers to conduct enhanced analysis of dietary intakes. FNDDS can also be used in other dietary studies to code foods/beverages and amounts eaten and to calculate the amounts of nutrients/food components in those items.    </p>\n<p>FNDDS is released every two-years in conjunction with the WWEIA, NHANES dietary data release.

    "description": "A listing of each accidental death associated with drug overdose in Connecticut from 2012 to 2024. A \"Y\" value under the different substance columns indicates that particular substance was detected.\n\nData are derived from an investigation by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner which includes the toxicity report, death certificate, as well as a scene investigation.\n\nThe “Morphine (Not Heroin)” values are related to the differences between how Morphine and Heroin are metabolized and therefor detected in the toxicity results. Heroin metabolizes to 6-MAM which then metabolizes to morphine.  6-MAM is unique to heroin, and has a short half-life (as does heroin itself). Thus, in some heroin deaths, the toxicity results will not indicate whether the morphine is from heroin or prescription morphine. In these cases the Medical Examiner may be able to determine the cause based on the scene investigation (such as  finding heroin needles). If they find prescription morphine at the scene it is certified as “Morphine (not heroin).”  Therefor, the Cause of Death may indicate Morphine, but the Heroin or Morphine (Not Heroin) may not be indicated.\n\n “Any Opioid” – If the Medical Examiner cannot conclude whether it’s RX Morphine or heroin based morphine in the toxicity results, that column may be checked",

    "title": "Forecasting demand data for critical materials",
    "description": "Clean energy technologies (e.g., solar, wind, EVs) are vital in our transition to a decarbonized energy grid. Many clean energy technologies rely on critical materials that are prone to supply chain risks. As the demand for clean energy technologies grows, so will the demand for these critical materials. Anticipating critical material market dynamics becomes crucial for change makers in developing effective strategies to scale up the implementation of clean energy generating technologies. This project identified and analyzed three materials critical to a clean economy and subsequently determines demand quantities (till 2050) for these materials via the Bass Diffusion Model. This work presents three datasets, namely the demand forecasts for critical materials, Gallium, Indium and Cobalt. Historical demand data was collected from scientific literature and used to compute the Bass model parameters, p and q, i.e., the coefficients of innovation and adoption respectively. The market size, N was based on previous work and the mean is assumed to be 50 million strong (lower limit:33 million and upper limit: 67 million). The Bass model was applied for all three cases and demand data has been forecasted for Gallium, Indium and Cobalt.",

These data are updated weekly as part of the ECHO data refresh, and ECHO offers many user-friendly options to explore data, including:\n\n• Facility Search: ECHO information is searchable by varied criteria, including location, facility type, and compliance status. Search results are customizable and downloadable.\n\n• Comparative Maps and State Dashboards: These tools offer aggregated information about facility compliance status, regulatory agency compliance monitoring, and enforcement activity at the national and state level.\n\n• Bulk Data Downloads: One of ECHO’s most popular features is the ability to work offline by downloading large data sets. Users can take advantage of the ECHO Exporter, which provides summary information about each facility in comma-separated values (csv) file format, or download data sets by program as zip files.",

    "description": "These datasets show surgical site infections (SSIs) reported by California hospitals to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAI) Program, via the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), in accordance with Health and Safety Code (HSC) section 1288.55. \r\n\r\nCalifornia hospitals track and report deep incisional and organ/space SSIs for adults and pediatric (<18 years of age) patients for 28 types of operative procedures: \r\nabdominal aortic aneurysm repair; abdominal hysterectomy; appendix surgery; bile duct, liver or pancreatic surgery, cardiac surgery; Cesarean section; colon surgery; coronary artery bypass graft with both chest and donor site incisions; coronary artery bypass graft with chest incision only*; exploratory abdominal surgery (laparotomy); gallbladder surgery; gastric surgery; heart transplant; hip prosthesis; kidney surgery; kidney transplant; knee prosthesis; laminectomy; liver transplant; open reduction of fracture; ovarian surgery; pacemaker surgery; rectal surgery; small bowel surgery; spinal fusion; spleen surgery; thoracic surgery; vaginal hysterectomy \r\n\r\nThe SSI data tables include information on the statewide and hospital-specific SSI incidence by operative procedure types, displaying procedure counts, number of infections observed (reported) and predicted. NHSN calculates the number of predicted infections using procedure-specific risk adjustment logistic regression models based on 2015 national baseline data and that accounts for particular patient-level factors and hospital characteristics found to be significant predictors of SSI incidence. \r\n\r\nDetailed information about the variables included in each dataset are described in the accompanying data dictionaries for the year of interest. For more information about NHSN’s statistical models, please review the “NHSN Guide to the SIR” at https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/ps-analysis-resources/index.html\r\n\r\nTo link the CDPH facility IDs with those from other Departments, like HCAI, please refer to the \"Licensed Facility Cross-Walk\" Open Data table at https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/licensed-facility-crosswalk\r\n\r\nFor more information about HAIs in California hospitals, please visit: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHCQ/HAI/Pages/AnnualHAIReports.aspx",

The sum of the five race-in-combination groups adds to more than the total population because individuals may report more than one race. Hispanic origin is considered an ethnicity, not a race. Hispanics may be of any race. Responses of 'Some Other Race' from the 2010 Census are modified. This results in differences between the population for specific race categories shown for the 2010 Census population in this file versus those in the original 2010 Census data. The estimates are based on the 2010 Census and reflect changes to the April 1, 2010 population due to the Count Question Resolution program and geographic program revisions. // Current data on births, deaths, and migration are used to calculate population change since the 2010 Census. An annual time series of estimates is produced, beginning with the census and extending to the vintage year. The vintage year (e.g., Vintage 2019) refers to the final year of the time series. The reference date for all estimates is July 1, unless otherwise specified. With each new issue of estimates, the entire estimates series is revised.

    "title": "National Land Cover Database (NLCD) Impervious Products",
    "description": "The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in association with the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium, produces the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) for the United States. The MRLC, a consortium of federal agencies who coordinate and generate consistent and relevant land cover information at the national scale for a wide variety of environmental, land management, and modeling applications, have been providing the scientific community with detailed land cover products for more than 30 years. Over that time, NLCD has been one of the most widely used geospatial datasets in the U.S., serving as a basis for understanding the Nation’s landscapes in thousands of studies and applications, trusted by scientists, land managers, students, city planners, and many more as a definitive source of U.S. land cover.\nNLCD land cover suite is created through the classification of Landsat imagery and uses partner data from the MRLC Consortium to help refine many of the land cover classes. The classification system used by NLCD is modified from the Anderson Land Cover Classification System. The NLCD Class Legend and Description is maintained at https://www.mrlc.gov/data/legends/national-land-cover-database-class-legend-and-description. The land cover theme includes two separate products. The first is a standard land cover product suite that provides 16 land cover classes for the conterminous United States and Alaska only land cover types and is available at https://www.mrlc.gov/data. The second product suite, NLCD Land Cover Science Products, provides additional discrimination and land cover classes differentiating grass and shrub and regenerating forest regime from grass and shrub and rangeland setting and is available at https://www.mrlc.gov/nlcd-2021-science-research-products. \nThe latest release of NLCD land cover spans the timeframe from 2001 to 2021 in 2 to 3-year intervals.   These new products use a streamlined compositing process for assembling and preprocessing Landsat imagery and geospatial ancillary datasets; a temporally, spectrally, and spatially integrated land cover change analysis strategy; a theme-based post-classification protocol for generating land cover and change products; a continuous fields biophysical parameters modeling method; and a scripted operational system.\nUnmasked Impervious - To produce the unmasked impervious layer a multilayered perceptron neural network (MLP) was deployed across CONUS. The MLP was trained to perform the regression task of predicting the 1-100 impervious fractional cover. To sample data to train the network, we broke CONUS into a grid comprised of 256x256 pixel regions of interest (ROIs) and sampled from that grid all ROIs with at least 40% impervious cover according to NLCD 2019 impervious fractional cover, which gave us samples from large impervious areas. From those ROIs, we then sampled 66 million training and 16 million validation data points with an even distribution across each impervious intensity (1-100). Those training points were then randomly split into 4 subsets, each corresponding to one of the following respective years: 2011, 2013, 2016, 2019. We used those points to query surface reflectance values from leaf-on composite and leaf-off synthetic imagery (see metadata for NLCD 2021 land cover), elevation data, and spatial urban intensity probabilities. The spatial urban intensity probabilities were generated by an ensemble of U-net models that were trained to predict the 4 urban intensity classes as defined by the NLCD product legend (open space, low intensity, medium intensity, high intensity). Two U-net models were trained using all ROIs in the CONUS 256x256 pixel grid. Inputs to these models included leaf-on composite and leaf-off synthetic imagery, and elevation data. To create the final training and validation datasets we randomly split the CONUS grid into to 2 equal sets: A and B. Using the ROIs from set A we queried the input features from the years 2011 and 2016 and from the ROIs in set B we queried input features from the years 2013 and 2019. These U-net models do not act as the final impervious predictors but instead as spatial feature generators. The spatial features learned by these convolutional neural networks were then fed into the pixel-based MLP, as spatial probabilities of urban intensity, to boost its predicting power. The U-nets were trained using categorical focal Jaccard loss and monitored with the Jaccard Index metric (IOU). The impervious fractional cover regression model (MLP) was trained using mean squared error as a loss function and monitored with mean absolute error as the metric.\nInitial impervious footprint - To generate an initial impervious footprint, three U-net models were trained on the multiclass-classification task of predicting “urban” and “roads”. The model was trained with 120,000 training and 40,000 validation 256X256 pixel Landsat image chips covering the entire extent of CONUS. The model inputs are consistent with what was used to generate the urban intensity U-net models; the only difference was the target mask the models were trained to predict. These models mapped all NLCD impervious footprint pixels to two classes (“urban” and “roads”); this was used to generate the impervious extent.\nImpervious Change Pixels - The initial 2021 impervious change pixels were created by comparing the 2021 urban footprint with the 2019 published urban descriptor and extracting the difference. These change pixels were manually edited for omission and commission errors. Ancillary data were then added to the change pixels to create the final 2021 impervious change pixels. These ancillary data consisted of solar installations, wind turbines, and roads. The solar installations dataset is an edited version of the Solar Photovoltaic Generating Units dataset produced by Kruitwagen et al (2021) (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5005867). The U.S. Wind Turbine Database from Hoen et al (2021) (https://doi.org/10.5066/F7TX3DN0) was used without edits. NavStreets road datasets were used in previous versions of NLCD but an updated version was not available to the USGS. New subdivision roads from the 2021 urban footprint and a small number of manually drawn roads were added to the 2021 impervious change pixels.\n2021 impervious extent - The final impervious change pixels were added to that 2019 impervious descriptor file to create the new 2021 impervious descriptor file. This file maps the extent of all impervious for the 2021 NLCD.\n2021 impervious product - The percent imperviousness values (1-100%) for the impervious change pixels were extracted from the unmasked impervious layer. Values for previously published urban remained the same except for areas that were 40% or more greater in value, in the unmasked impervious layer.\n2021 impervious descriptor - The final impervious change pixels were mapped to the class legend for the NLCD 2019 published impervious descriptor. These pixels were then added to the NLCD 2019 impervious descriptor file to create the new 2021 impervious descriptor file.",

    "description": "This data collection of the 3D Elevation Program (3DEP) \nconsists of Lidar Point Cloud (LPC) projects as provided to the USGS. These point cloud files contain all the original lidar points collected, with the original spatial reference and units preserved. These data may have been used as the source of updates to the 1/3-arcsecond,\n1-arcsecond, and 2-arcsecond seamless 3DEP Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). The 3DEP data holdings serve as the elevation layer of The National Map, and provide foundational elevation information for earth science studies and mapping applications in the United\nStates. Lidar (Light detection and ranging) discrete-return point cloud data are available in LAZ format. The LAZ format is a lossless compressed version of the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) LAS format. Point Cloud data can be converted from LAZ to LAS or LAS to LAZ without the loss of any information.  Either format stores 3-dimensional point cloud data and point attributes along with header information and variable length records specific to the data. Millions of data points are stored as a 3-dimensional data cloud as a series of geo-referenced x, y coordinates and z (elevation), as well as other attributes for each point. Additonal information about the las file format can be found here: https://www.asprs.org/divisions-committees/lidar-division/laser-las-file-format-exchange-activities. All 3DEP products are public domain.",

Prior to 2003, Asian and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders were classified as one combined group.

    "description": "<p>The Resident Assessment Instrument/Minimum Data Set (RAI/MDS) is a comprehensive assessment and care planning process used by the nursing home industry since 1990 as a requirement for nursing home participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The RAI/MDS provides data for monitoring changes in resident status that are consistent and reliable over time. The VA commitment to quality propelled the implementation of the RAI/MDS in its nursing homes now known as VA Community Living Centers (CLC). In addition to providing consistent clinical information, the RAI/MDS can be used as a measure of both quality and resource utilization, thereby serving as a benchmark for quality and cost data within the VA as well as with community based nursing facilities. Workload based on RAI/MDS can be calculated electronically by the interactions of the elements of the MDS data and grouped into 53 categories referred to as Resource Utilization Groups (RUG-IV). Residents are assessed quarterly. The data is grouped for analysis at the Austin Information Technology Center (AITC). Conversion to electronic data entry and transmission to the AITC was completed system-wide by year-end 2000. In 2010, the Centeres for Medicare and Medicaide Services released a significantly upgraded version, MDS 3.0, to begin to be implemented on October 1, 2011 in VHA CLCs.  Training is underway currently.  The MDS 3.0 will generate a new set of Quality Indicators and Quality Monitors as well the RUGs will increase to 64 RUGs from the current 53 RUG groups.</p>",

    "title": "United States Stage IV Quantitative Precipitation Archive",
    "description": "This dataset offers hourly estimates of radar indicated rain gage corrected precipitation at a roughly 4km spatial resolution. Mosaicked into a national product at NCEP, from the regional hourly multi-sensor (radar+gauges) precipitation analyses produced by the 12 River Forecast Centers over CONUS. Some manual QC done at the RFCs. The Stage II/IV job is run at 33min past the top of each hour. Hourly Stage IV is re-made hourly (if there is new input after valid time for the next 23 hours, then again at 1/3/5/7 days after valid time. These data have been aggregated into this service by the USGS and are downloaded and incorporated into the archive every 30 minutes. The original Hydrologic Rainfall Analysis Projection grid cell locations redefined by unprojecting grid cell locations using spherical earth projection algorithms. The cell lat/lon locations should be interpreted as being on a modern geodetic datum. This transformation is needed because the original grid cell location's lat/lon values were on a geodetic datum but were assumed to be on a spherical datum. See: http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2013/3035/pdf/fs2013-3035.pdf for more information. Note that this publication references the National Precipitation Verification Unit. The data represented here are aggregated from the same source as the National Precipitation Verification Unit used prior to being shut down.

OTIS reports case counts, incidence rates, population counts, percentage of cases that completed therapy within 1 year of diagnosis, and percentage of cases tested for drug susceptibility. Data for 22 variables are included in the data set, including: age groups, race / ethnicity, sex, vital status, year reported, state, metropolitan area, several patient risk factors, directly observed therapy, disease verification criteria and multi-drug resistant TB. Each year these data are updated with an additional year of cases plus revisions to cases reported in previous years.

    "description": "EMAG2v3 is a global Earth Magnetic Anomaly Grid compiled from satellite, ship, and airborne magnetic measurements.  It is a significant update of the previous release of the Earth Magnetic Anomaly Grid. The resolution remains 2 arc-minutes, and the altitude of 4 km above the geoid is still supported, but an additional product, a grid that is observed at sea-level over oceanic regions, has been produced. New additions grid and track line data have been included, both over land and the oceans. Wherever available, the original shipborne and airborne data were used instead of precompiled oceanic magnetic grids. Interpolation between sparse track lines in the oceans was improved by using a kriging algorithm, which specializes in heterogeneous data distribution gridding, in order to create a compilation as true to the observed data as possible, and avoid using a priori information. The longest wavelengths (>300 km) were replaced with the latests satellite lithosphere magnetic field model, MF7.",

The Comma-Separated Values (CSV) file table_JulyHWMs.csv contains 547 surveyed HWMs on 31 rivers from the Vermont flood of July 2023. In addition, a comparison between surveyed HWM data from the July 2023 flood and from Tropical Storm Irene in 2011 is included in the data release. The data from the two events--where HWMs were co-located and surveyed--are compared in the file table_HWMcompare.csv. Elevation differences were calculated as the July 2023 HWM surveyed elevation minus Tropical Storm Irene HWM surveyed elevation at the same site. Sites are defined as areas on a river that are expected to have the same hydraulic setting, for example, immediately downstream of a bridge.\nThese data are also hosted on the USGS Flood Event Viewer (https://stn.wim.usgs.gov/FEV/).",

Sharing data, associated tools, methodologies and results, rather than just summaries or interpretations, accelerates research progress. Community-wide sharing requires common data definitions and standards, as well as comprehensive and coherent informatics approaches for the sharing of de-identified human subject research data. Built on the National Database for Autism Research (NDAR) informatics platform, NDCT provides a comprehensive data sharing platform for NIMH grantees supporting clinical trials.</p>",

    "description": "World Ocean Atlas 2023 (WOA23) is a set of objectively analyzed (one degree grid and quarter degree grid) climatological fields of in situ temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, Apparent Oxygen Utilization (AOU), percent oxygen saturation, phosphate, silicate, and nitrate at standard depth levels for annual, seasonal, and monthly compositing periods for the World Ocean. Quarter degree fields are for temperature and salinity only. It also includes associated statistical fields of observed oceanographic profile data interpolated to standard depth levels on quarter degree, one degree, and five degree grids. Temperature and salinity fields are available for seven decades (1955-1964, 1965-1974, 1975-1984, 1985-1994, 1995-2004, 2005-2014, and 2015-2022), for three thirty year \"climate normal\" periods (1971-2000, 1981-2010, and 1991-2020), and for an average of the seven individual decades (1955-2022). Oxygen fields (as well as AOU and percent oxygen saturation) are available using all quality controlled bottle, CTD, and profiling float data from 1965-2022 as well as a thirty year \"climate normal\" using bottle and CTD data for 1971-2000. Nutrient fields are available using all quality controlled bottle data from the entire sampling period between 1965-2022. This accession is a product generated by the National Centers for Environmental Information's (NCEI) Ocean Climate Laboratory Team. The analyses are derived from the NCEI World Ocean Database 2023.",

    "title": "Citywide Payroll Data (Fiscal Year)",
    "description": "Data is collected because of public interest in how the City’s budget is being spent on salary and overtime pay for all municipal employees. Data is input into the City's Personnel Management System (“PMS”) by the respective user Agencies. Each record represents the following statistics for every city employee: Agency, Last Name, First Name, Middle Initial, Agency Start Date, Work Location Borough, Job Title Description, Leave Status as of the close of the FY (June 30th), Base Salary, Pay Basis, Regular Hours Paid, Regular Gross Paid, Overtime Hours worked, Total Overtime Paid, and Total Other Compensation (i.e. lump sum and/or retro payments). This data can be used to analyze how the City's financial resources are allocated and how much of the City's budget is being devoted to overtime. The reader of this data should be aware that increments of salary increases received over the course of any one fiscal year will not be reflected. All that is captured, is the employee's final base and gross salary at the end of the fiscal year.  In very limited cases, a check replacement and subsequent refund may reflect both the original check as well as the re-issued check in employee pay totals.  \r\n<br>\r\n<b>NOTE 1: </b>To further improve the visibility into the number of employee OT hours worked, beginning with the FY 2023 report, an updated methodology will be used which will eliminate redundant reporting of OT hours in some specific instances.  In the previous calculation, hours associated with both overtime pay as well as an accompanying overtime “companion code” pay were included in the employee total even though they represented pay for the same period of time.  With the updated methodology, the dollars shown on the Open Data site will continue to be inclusive of both types of overtime, but the OT hours will now reflect a singular block of time, which will result in a more representative total of employee OT hours worked.   The updated methodology will primarily impact the OT hours associated with City employees in uniformed civil service titles.  The updated methodology will be applied to the Open Data posting for Fiscal Year 2023 and cannot be applied to prior postings and, as a result, the reader of this data should not compare OT <b>hours</b>  prior to the 2023 report against OT hours published starting Fiscal Year 2023.  The reader of this data may continue to compare OT <b>dollars</b> across all published Fiscal Years on Open Data. \r\n<br>\r\n<b>NOTE 2: </b>As a part of FISA-OPA’s routine process for reviewing and releasing Citywide Payroll Data, data for some agencies (specifically NYC Police Department (NYPD) and the District Attorneys’ Offices (Manhattan, Kings, Queens, Richmond, Bronx, and Special Narcotics)) have been redacted since they are exempt from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Law, POL § 87(2)(f), on the ground that disclosure of the information could endanger the life and safety of the public servants listed thereon. They are further exempt from disclosure pursuant to POL § 87(2)(e)(iii), on the ground that any release of the information would identify confidential sources or disclose confidential information relating to a criminal investigation, and POL § 87(2)(e)(iv), on the ground that disclosure would reveal non-routine criminal investigative techniques or procedures. Some of these redactions will appear as XXX in the name columns.",

    "description": "The Geocoded Disasters (GDIS) Dataset is a geocoded extension of a selection of natural disasters from the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters' (CRED) Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT). The data set encompasses 39,953 locations for 9,924 disasters that occurred worldwide in the years 1960 to 2018. All floods, storms (typhoons, monsoons etc.), earthquakes, landslides, droughts, volcanic activity and extreme temperatures that were recorded in EM-DAT during these 58 years and could be geocoded are included in the data set. The highest spatial resolution in the data set corresponds to administrative level 3 (usually district/commune/village) in the Global Administrative Areas database (GADM, 2018). The vast majority of the locations are administrative level 1 (typically state/province/region).",

The CRDC is a longstanding and important aspect of the ED Office for Civil Rights (OCR) overall strategy for administering and enforcing the civil rights statutes for which it is responsible. \n\nData was reported directly from the school districts to the Office of Civil Rights. This data process is not managed by OSPI and therefore the data is not validated or reviewed by OSPI before being reported to OCR. For this reason data presented in this file will not mirror  OSPI reports on similar student and school measures.  The 2017-18 data in the report represents the most recent data made publicly available by the CRDC as of 5/10/2021.\n\nIn some cases data was unavailable or suppressed by OCR to protect student privacy, for more information on this please visit the CRDC webpage. In addition, directory information for some schools is incomplete, as the names of the organizations provided in the CRDC data files did not match the names of organizations on record with OSPI.\n\nFor additional information or questions about this data please visit the CRDC webpage at https://ocrdata.ed.gov/.",

    "description": "The 2023 cartographic boundary shapefiles are simplified representations of selected geographic areas from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). These boundary files are specifically designed for small-scale thematic mapping. When possible, generalization is performed with the intent to maintain the hierarchical relationships among geographies and to maintain the alignment of geographies within a file set for a given year. Geographic areas may not align with the same areas from another year. Some geographies are available as nation-based files while others are available only as state-based files.\n\nMetropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas are together termed Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) and are defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and consist of the county or counties or equivalent entities associated with at least one urban core of at least 10,000 population, plus adjacent counties having a high degree of social and economic integration with the core as measured through commuting ties with the counties containing the core. Categories of CBSAs are: Metropolitan Statistical Areas, based on urban areas of 50,000 or more population; and Micropolitan Statistical Areas, based on urban areas of at least 10,000 population but less than 50,000 population.\n\nThe generalized boundaries in this file are based on those defined by OMB based on the 2020 Census and published in 2023.",

    "description": "With increasing concerns about freshwater cyanobacteria blooms, there is a need to identify which waterbodies are at risk for developing these blooms, especially those that produce cyanotoxins. To address this concern, we developed spatial statistical models using the US National Lakes Assessment, a survey with over 3,000 spring and summer observations of cyanobacteria abundance and microcystin concentration in lakes across the conterminous US. We combined these observations with other nationally available data to model which lake and watershed factors best explain the presence of harmful cyanobacterial blooms. We then used these models to estimate the cyanobacteria abundance and probability of microcystin detection in 124,500 lakes across the CONUS. This dataset includes the compiled data used to generate the models and the dataset used to generate prediction for a much larger population of lakes. The data package includes two tabular data files, two tabular metadata files, and one methods document.  ",

This includes responses to Medical Incidents requiring EMS staff. Each record includes the call number, incident number, address, unit identifier, call type, and disposition. All relevant time intervals are also included. Because this dataset is based on responses, and since most calls involve multiple units, there are multiple records for each call number. Addresses are associated with an intersection or call box, not a specific address.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThis dataset is an extract from the Department of Emergency Management’s computer-aided dispatch system. The dataset is enhanced with fire-department specific information before being uploaded to the open data portal.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThis dataset updates daily via automated data pipeline.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis dataset is based on responses, and since most calls involve multiple units, there are multiple records for each call number. The most common call types are Medical Incidents, Alarms, Structure Fires, and Traffic Collisions. \n\n<strong>E.

The data set combines the best available roads data by country into a global roads coverage, using the UN Spatial Data Infrastructure Transport (UNSDI-T) version 2 as a common data model. All country road networks have been joined topologically at the borders, and many countries have been edited for internal topology. Source data for each country are provided in the documentation, and users are encouraged to refer to the readme file for use constraints that apply to a small number of countries. Because the data are compiled from multiple sources, the date range for road network representations ranges from the 1980s to 2010 depending on the country (most countries have no confirmed date), and spatial accuracy varies. The baseline global data set was compiled by the Information Technology Outreach Services (ITOS) of the University of Georgia. Updated data for 27 countries and 6 smaller geographic entities were assembled by Columbia University's Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN), with a focus largely on developing countries with the poorest data coverage.",

These categories track performance and progress on three broad policy objectives, environmental health, ecosystem vitality, and climate change. The EPI's proximity-to-target methodology facilitates cross-country comparisons among economic and regional peer groups. The data set includes the 2022 EPI, component scores, and time-series source data.

    "title": "PLACES: Local Data for Better Health, County Data 2023 release",
    "description": "This dataset contains model-based county estimates. PLACES covers the entire United States—50 states and the District of Columbia—at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area levels. It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at four geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. This dataset includes estimates for 36 measures: 13 for health outcomes, 9 for preventive services use, 4 for chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, 7 for disabilities, and 3 for health status. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates are Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2021 or 2020 data, Census Bureau 2021 or 2020 county population estimate data, and American Community Survey 2017–2021, or 2016–2020 estimates. The 2023 release uses 2021 BRFSS data for 29 measures and 2020 BRFSS data for 7 measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, cervical cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleeping less than 7 hours) that the survey collects data on every other year. More information about the methodology can be found at  www.cdc.gov/places.",

    "description": "The Motor Vehicle Collisions vehicle table contains details on each vehicle involved in the crash. Each row represents a motor vehicle involved in a crash. The data in this table goes back to April 2016 when crash reporting switched to an electronic system.\r\n</p>\r\nThe Motor Vehicle Collisions data tables contain information from all police reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC. The police report (MV104-AN) is required to be filled out for collisions where someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage (https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/ny_overlay_mv-104an_rev05_2004.pdf).  It should be noted that the data is preliminary and subject to change when the MV-104AN forms are amended based on revised crash details.\r\n</p>\r\nDue to success of the CompStat program, NYPD began to ask how to apply the CompStat principles  to other problems.  Other than homicides, the fatal incidents with which police have the most contact with the public are fatal traffic collisions.  Therefore in April 1998, the Department implemented TrafficStat, which uses the CompStat model to work towards improving traffic safety.  Police officers complete form MV-104AN  for all vehicle collisions.  The MV-104AN is a New York State form that has all of the details of a traffic collision.  Before implementing Trafficstat, there was no uniform traffic safety data collection procedure for all of the NYPD precincts.  Therefore, the Police Department implemented the Traffic Accident Management System (TAMS) in July 1999 in order to collect traffic data in a uniform method across the City.  TAMS required the precincts manually enter a few selected MV-104AN fields to collect very basic intersection traffic crash statistics which included the number of accidents, injuries and fatalities. As the years progressed, there grew a need for additional traffic data so that more detailed analyses could be conducted. The Citywide traffic safety initiative, Vision Zero started in the year 2014.  Vision Zero further emphasized the need for the collection of more traffic data in order to work towards the Vision Zero goal, which is to eliminate traffic fatalities.  Therefore, the Department in March 2016 replaced the TAMS with the new Finest Online Records Management System (FORMS).  FORMS enables the police officers to electronically, using a Department cellphone or computer, enter all of the MV-104AN data fields and stores all of the MV-104AN data fields in the Department’s crime data warehouse.  Since all of the MV-104AN data fields are now stored for each traffic collision, detailed traffic safety analyses can be conducted as applicable.",

    "description": "This dataset contains model-based county-level estimates for the PLACES project 2020 release in GIS-friendly format. The PLACES project is the expansion of the original 500 Cities project and covers the entire United States—50 states and the District of Columbia (DC)—at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code tabulation Areas (ZCTA) levels. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2018 or 2017 data, Census Bureau 2018 or 2017 county population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2014-2018 or 2013-2017 estimates. The 2020 release uses 2018 BRFSS data for 23 measures and 2017 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, and cholesterol screening). Four measures are based on the 2017 BRFSS data because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS. These data can be joined with the census 2015 county boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 27 measures at the county level. An ArcGIS Online feature service is also available at https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=8eca985039464f4d83467b8f6aeb1320 for users to make maps online or to add data to desktop GIS software.",

    "description": "This data provides annual average daily total solar resource averaged over surface cells of 0.038 degrees in both latitude and longitude, or nominally 4 km in size. The solar radiation values represent the resource available to solar energy systems. The data was created using cloud properties which are generated using the AVHRR Pathfinder Atmospheres-Extended (PATMOS-x) algorithms. Fast all-sky radiation model for solar applications (FARMS) in conjunction with the cloud properties, and aerosol optical depth (AOD) and precipitable water vapor (PWV) from ancillary source are used to estimate direct normal irradiance (DNI) and global horizontal irradiance (GHI). The DNI and GHI are computed for clear skies using the REST2 model. For cloud scenes identified by the cloud mask, the FARMS is used to compute the GHI. The DNI for cloud scenes is then computed using the DISC model. The data are averaged from hourly model output over 19 years (1998-2016). The PATMOS-X model uses half-hourly radiance images in visible and infrared channels from the GOES series of geostationary weather satellites, daily snow cover data from the NSIDC and mixing ratio, temperature and pressure profiles from the Modern Era-Retrospective Analysis (MERRA-2) dataset. The REST2 model uses hourly aerosol optical depth from MERRA-2 to calculate GHI and DNI; water vapor and other inputs for REST 2 are obtained from the MERRA-2.\n\nThis dataset was derived from the NSRDB and may be used with the following citation:\n\nSengupta, M., Xie, Y., Lopez, A., Habte, A., Maclaurin, G., & Shelby, J.

EDFacts GD:2014-15 (ed.gov/about/inits/ed/edfacts) annually collects cross-sectional data from states about student who graduate or receive a certificate of completion from secondary education or students who dropped out of secondary education at the school, LEA, and state levels. EDFacts GD:2014-15 data were collected using the EDFacts Submission System (ESS), a centralized portal and their submission by states is mandatory and required for benefits. Not submitting the required reports by a state constitutes a failure to comply with law and may have consequences for federal funding to the state. Key statistics produced from EDFacts GD:2014-15 are from 6 data groups with information on Regulatory Cohort Graduation Rate (Four, Five, and Six Year)-Graduation Rate; Regulatory Cohort Graduation Rate (Four, Five, and Six Year)-Student Counts; Graduation Rate; Graduates/Completers; Regulatory Cohort Graduation Rate-Flex; and Regulatory Cohort Graduation Rate Student Counts-Flex. For the purposes of this system, data groups are referred to as 'variables', as a result of the structure and format of EDFacts' data.",

    "description": "Overall attendance data include students in Districts 1-32 and 75 (Special Education). Students in District 79 (Alternative Schools & Programs), charter schools, home schooling, and home and hospital instruction are excluded. Pre-K data do not include NYC Early Education Centers or District Pre-K Centers; therefore, Pre-K data are limited to those who attend K-12 schools that offer Pre-K. Transfer schools are included in citywide, borough, and district counts but removed from school-level files.\nAttendance is attributed to the school the student attended at the time. If a student attends multiple schools in a school year, the student will contribute data towards multiple schools.\nStarting in 2020-21, the NYC DOE transitioned to NYSED's definition of chronic absenteeism. Students are considered chronically absent if they have an attendance of 90 percent or less (i.e. students who are absent 10 percent or more of the total days). In order to be included in chronic absenteeism calculations, students must be enrolled for at least 10 days (regardless of whether present or absent) and must have been present for at least 1 day. The NYSED chronic absenteeism definition is applied to all prior years in the report.\nSchool-level chronic absenteeism data reflect chronic absenteeism at a particular school. In order to eliminate double-counting students in chronic absenteeism counts, calculations at the district, borough, and citywide levels include all attendance data that contribute to the given geographic category. For example, if a student was chronically absent at one school but not at another, the student would only be counted once in the citywide calculation. For this reason, chronic absenteeism counts will not align across files.\nAll demographic data are based on a student's most recent record in a given year.\nStudents With Disabilities (SWD) data do not include Pre-K students since Pre-K students are screened for IEPs only at the parents' request.\nEnglish language learner (ELL) data do not include Pre-K students since the New York State Education Department only begins administering assessments to be identified as an ELL in Kindergarten.\nOnly grades PK-12 are shown, but calculations for \"All Grades\" also include students missing a grade level, so PK-12 may not add up to \"All Grades\". \nData include students missing a gender, but are not shown due to small cell counts.\nData for Asian students include Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islanders . Multi-racial and Native American students, as well as students missing ethnicity/race data are included in the \"Other\" ethnicity category.\nIn order to comply with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) regulations on public reporting of education outcomes, rows with five or fewer students are suppressed, and have been replaced with an \"s\". Using total days of attendance as a proxy , rows with 900 or fewer total days are suppressed. In addition, other rows have been replaced with an \"s\" when they could reveal, through addition or subtraction, the underlying numbers that have been redacted. Chronic absenteeism values are suppressed, regardless of total days, if the number of students who contribute  at least 20 days is five or fewer. \nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting shift to remote learning in March 2020, 2019-20 attendance data was only available for September 2019 through March 13, 2020. Interactions data from the spring of 2020 are reported on a separate tab.\nInteractions were reported by schools during remote learning, from April 6 2020 through June 26 2020 (a total of 57 instructional days, excluding special professional development days of June 4 and June 9). Schools were required to indicate any student from their roster that did not have an interaction on a given day. Schools were able to define interactions in a way that made sense for their students and families. Definitions of an interaction included:\n• Student submission of an assignment or completion of an",

    "title": "NIST Chemical Kinetics Database",
    "description": "The NIST Chemical Kinetics Database includes essentially all reported kinetics results for thermal gas-phase chemical reactions. The database is designed to be searched for kinetics data based on the specific reactants involved, for reactions resulting in specified products, for all the reactions of a particular species, or for various combinations of these. In addition, the bibliography can be searched by author name or combination of names. The database contains in excess of 38,000 separate reaction records for over 11,700 distinct reactant pairs. These data have been abstracted from over 12,000 papers with literature coverage through early 2000. Rate constant records for a specified reaction are found by searching the Reaction Database. All rate constant records for that reaction are returned, with a link to 'Details' on that record. Each rate constant record contains the following information (as available): a) Reactants and, if defined, reaction products; b) Rate parameters: A, n, Ea/R, where k = A* (T/298)**n exp[-(Ea/R)/T], where T is the temperature in Kelvins; c) Uncertainty in A, n, and Ea/R, if reported; d) Temperature range of experiment or temperature range of validity of a review or theoretical paper; e) Pressure range and bulk gas of the experiment; f) Data type of the record (i.e., experimental, relative rate measurement, theoretical calculation, modeling result, etc.). If the result is a relative rate measurement, then the reaction to which the rate is relative is also given; g) Experimental procedure, including separate fields for the description of the apparatus, the time resolution of the experiment, and the excitation technique. A majority of contemporary chemical kinetics methods are represented. The Kinetics Database is being expanded to include other resources for the convenience of the users. Presently this includes direct links to the corresponding NIST WebBook page for all substances for which such a link is possible. This is indicated by underling and highlighting the species. The WebBook provides thermodynamic, spectral, and other data on the species. Note that the link to the WebBook is opened as a new frame in your browser.",

(There are 3 other related data sets: 1-Contact Details 2-Enforcement Summary, and 3-Compliance Details)\n\nAnnually, or when a UST is installed, removed, or altered, a notification form must be completed via EZFile (see link) and submitted to CT DEEP. Notification is required for non-residential underground storage tanks, including those for oil, petroleum and chemical liquids, as well as residential home heating oil tanks serving five or more units.  See online at: https://www.ct.gov/deep/cwp/view.asp?q=322600\n\nThe underground storage tank regulations and the Connecticut underground storage tank enforcement program have been in effect since November 1985. This list is based on notification information submitted by the public since 1985, and is updated weekly. This list contains information on both active and on non-active USTs, as well as federally regulated and state regulated USTs.\n\nFactors to Consider When Using this data:\n\n-Not every required notification form is submitted to the DEEP. We can only enter the information we receive.\n\n-We know there are errors in the data although we strive to minimize them. Error examples may include: notification forms completed incorrectly by the owner/operator, data entry errors, duplicate site information, misspelled names and addresses and/or missing data.",

    "description": "<p>The dataset, Survey-SR, provides the nutrient data for assessing dietary intakes from the national survey What We Eat In America, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (WWEIA, NHANES). Historically, USDA databases have been used for national nutrition monitoring (1). Currently, the Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) (2), is used by Food Surveys Research Group, ARS, to process dietary intake data from WWEIA, NHANES. Nutrient values for FNDDS are based on Survey-SR. Survey-SR was referred to as the \"Primary Data Set\" in older publications. Early versions of the dataset were composed mainly of commodity-type items such as wheat flour, sugar, milk, etc. However, with increased consumption of commercial processed and restaurant foods and changes in how national nutrition monitoring data are used (1), many commercial processed and restaurant items have been added to Survey-SR. \n \nThe current version, Survey-SR 2013-2014, is mainly based on the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference (SR) 28 (2) and contains sixty-six nutrientseach for 3,404 foods. These nutrient data will be used for assessing intake data from WWEIA, NHANES 2013-2014. Nutrient profiles were added for 265 new foods and updated for about 500 foods from the version used for the previous survey (WWEIA, NHANES 2011-12).  New foods added include mainly commercially processed foods such as several gluten-free products, milk substitutes, sauces and condiments such as sriracha, pesto and wasabi, Greek yogurt, breakfast cereals, low-sodium meat products, whole grain pastas and baked products, and several beverages including bottled tea and coffee, coconut water, malt beverages, hard cider, fruit-flavored drinks, fortified fruit juices and fruit and/or vegetable smoothies. Several school lunch pizzas and chicken products, fast-food sandwiches, and new beef cuts were also added, as they are now reported more frequently by survey respondents. Nutrient profiles were updated for several commonly consumed foods such as cheddar, mozzarella and American cheese, ground beef, butter, and catsup. The changes in nutrient values may be due to reformulations in products, changes in the market shares of brands, or more accurate data. Examples of more accurate data include analytical data, market share data, and data from a nationally representative sample. </p><div><br>Resources in this dataset:</div><br><ul><li><p>Resource Title: USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference Dataset for What We Eat In America, NHANES 2013-14 (Survey SR 2013-14).</p> <p>File Name: SurveySR_2013_14 (1).zip</p><p>Resource Description: Access database downloaded on November 16, 2017.

    "title": "NOAA Next Generation Radar (NEXRAD) Level 3 Products",
    "description": "This dataset consists of Level 3 weather radar products collected from Next-Generation Radar (NEXRAD) stations located in the contiguous United States, Alaska, Hawaii, U.S. territories and at military base sites. NEXRAD is a network of 160 high-resolution Doppler weather radars operated by the NOAA National Weather Service (NWS), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the U.S. Air Force (USAF). Doppler radars detect atmospheric precipitation and winds, which allow scientists to track and anticipate weather events, such as rain, ice pellets, snow, hail, and tornadoes, as well as some non-weather objects like birds and insects. NEXRAD stations use the Weather Surveillance Radar - 1988, Doppler (WSR-88D) system. This is a 10 cm wavelength (S-Band) radar that operates at a frequency between 2,700 and 3,000 MHz. The radar system operates in two basic modes: a slow-scanning Clear Air Mode (Mode B) for analyzing air movements when there is little or no precipitation activity in the area, and a Precipitation Mode (Mode A) with a faster scan for tracking active weather. The two modes employ nine Volume Coverage Patterns (VCPs) to adequately sample the atmosphere based on weather conditions. A VCP is a series of 360 degree sweeps of the antenna at pre-determined elevation angles and pulse repetition frequencies completed in a specified period of time. The radar scan times 4.5, 5, 6 or 10 minutes depending on the selected VCP. During 2008, the WSR-88D radars were upgraded to produce increased spatial resolution data, called Super Resolution. The earlier Legacy Resolution data provides radar reflectivity at 1.0 degree azimuthal by 1 km range gate resolution to a range of 460 km, and Doppler velocity and spectrum width at 1.0 degree azimuthal by 250 m range gate resolution to a range of 230 km. The upgraded Super Resolution data provides radar reflectivity at 0.5 degree azimuthal by 250 m range gate resolution to a range of 460 km, and Doppler velocity and spectrum width at 0.5 degree azimuthal by 250 m range gate resolution to a range of 300 km. Super resolution makes a compromise of slightly decreased noise reduction for a large gain in resolution. In 2010, the deployment of the Dual Polarization (Dual Pol) capability to NEXRAD sites began with the first operational Dual Pol radar in May 2011. Dual Pol radar capability adds vertical polarization to the previous horizontal radar waves, in order to more accurately discern the return signal. This allows the radar to better distinguish between types of precipitation (e.g., rain, hail and snow), improves rainfall estimates, improves data retrieval in mountainous terrain, and aids in removal of non-weather artifacts. The NEXRAD products are divided in two data processing levels. The lower Level 2 data are base products at original resolution. Level 2 data are recorded at all NWS and most USAF and FAA WSR-88D sites. From the Level 2 quantities, computer processing generates numerous meteorological analysis Level 3 products. The Level 3 data consists of reduced resolution, low-bandwidth, base products as well as many derived, post-processed products. Level 3 products are recorded at most U.S. sites, though non-US sites do not have Level 3 products. There are over 40 Level 3 products available from the NCDC. General products for Level 3 include the base and composite reflectivity, storm relative velocity, vertical integrated liquid, echo tops and VAD wind profile. Precipitation products for Level 3 include estimated ground accumulated rainfall amounts for one and three hour periods, storm totals, and digital arrays. Estimates are based on reflectivity to rainfall rate (Z-R) relationships. Overlay products for Level 3 are alphanumeric data that give detailed information on certain parameters for an identified storm cell. These include storm structure, hail index, mesocyclone identification, tornadic vortex signature, and storm tracking information. Radar messages for Level 3 are sent by the radar site to users in order to know more about the radar status and special product data. NEXRAD data are provided to the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) for archiving and dissemination to users. Data coverage varies by station and ranges from May 1992 to 1 day from present. Most stations began observing in the mid-1990s, and most period of records are continuous.",

In recognizing the deficiency in global tropical cyclone data, and the lack of a publically available dataset, the IBTrACS dataset was produced, which, for the first time, combines existing best track data from over 10 international forecast centers. The dataset contains the position, maximum sustained winds, minimum central pressure, and storm nature for every tropical cyclone globally at 6-hr intervals in UTC. Statistics from the merge are also provided (such as number of centers tracking the storm, range in pressure, median wind speed, etc.). The dataset period is from 1848 to the present with dataset updates performed annually in August. The dataset is archived as netCDF files but can be accessed via a variety of user-friendly formats to facilitate data analysis, including netCDF, Shapefile, and CSV formatted files. The update to version 3 data includes new data sources, bug fixes, shapefile-support, discontinued support of ASCII and new variables.",

    "description": "The 2020 cartographic boundary KMLs are simplified representations of selected geographic areas from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). These boundary files are specifically designed for small-scale thematic mapping. When possible, generalization is performed with the intent to maintain the hierarchical relationships among geographies and to maintain the alignment of geographies within a file set for a given year. Geographic areas may not align with the same areas from another year. Some geographies are available as nation-based files while others are available only as state-based files.\n\nZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) are approximate area representations of U.S. Postal Service (USPS) ZIP Code service areas that the Census Bureau creates to present statistical data for each decennial census. The Census Bureau delineates ZCTA boundaries for the United States, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands once each decade following the decennial census. Data users should not use ZCTAs to identify the official USPS ZIP Code for mail delivery. The USPS makes periodic changes to ZIP Codes to support more efficient mail delivery.\n\nThe Census Bureau uses tabulation blocks as the basis for defining each ZCTA. Tabulation blocks are assigned to a ZCTA based on the most frequently occurring ZIP Code for the addresses contained within that block. The most frequently occurring ZIP Code also becomes the five-digit numeric code of the ZCTA. These codes may contain leading zeros.\n\nBlocks that do not contain addresses but are surrounded by a single ZCTA (enclaves) are assigned to the surrounding ZCTA. Because the Census Bureau only uses the most frequently occurring ZIP Code to assign blocks, a ZCTA may not exist for every USPS ZIP Code. Some ZIP Codes may not have a matching ZCTA because too few addresses were associated with the specific ZIP Code or the ZIP Code was not the most frequently occurring ZIP Code within any of the blocks where it exists.\n\nThe generalized ZCTA boundaries in this file are based on those delineated following the 2020 Census.",

    "description": "The North American Bird Banding Program is administered through the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Bird Banding Laboratory (BBL), Eastern Ecological Science Center at the Patuxent Research Refuge (EESC) and  the Bird Banding Office (BBO), Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC). The respective banding offices have similar functions and policies and use the same bands, reporting forms and data formats. This long-term dataset (1960-2023) consists of over 83 million bird banding, encounter and recapture records of over 1,000 species covered under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA). Data is contributed by US and Canadian bird banding permit holders: federal, state, tribal, local government, non-government agencies, business, university and avocational biologists. Banders capture wild birds and mark them with a metal leg band with a unique 9-digit number. Extra markers may be added. Attributes such as age, sex, condition of bird may be included. Prior to data release, all locations for sensitive species and gamebirds are generalized to larger areas; 10-minute and 1-degree block coordinate precisions respectively. Sensitive species include diurnal raptors, US Threatened, Endangered, and Canadian Species at Risk Act (SARA) species. Gamebirds include waterfowl, cranes, rails, woodcock, doves, crows and ravens. Data are curated at BBL daily, therefore each yearly version may differ from previous releases. Incoming data must pass validation rules to meet quality standards; however, data accuracy is ultimately determined by contributors.",

    "description": "Location of fish aggregation device (FAD) buoys within the Main Hawaiian Islands.\n\nFishermen in Hawaii and other parts of the world have long known that tunas and other pelagic fishes are attracted to floating objects. Fishermen have benefited from this behavior by fishing around floating logs, nets, debris and other flotsam. Hawaii has capitalized on this phenomena by placing FADs in the waters surrounding the Hawaiian Islands. In these waters, schools of tunas and other important pelagic fishes such as dolphin-fish (mahi-mahi), wahoo (ono), and billfishes can be induced to congregate and remain for periods of time in an area so that fishers can easily locate them. Thus, the FADs are used to \"attract\" and \"hold\" pelagic fishes in areas to enhance fishing.\n\nNOTE: Please do not rely on these buoys to check your position. Most buoys have only been located to the nearest 0.1 minute (6 seconds). In addition, each buoy has a watch circle that can be as much as 1 mile in diameter.",

The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas are together termed Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) and are defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and consist of the county or counties or equivalent entities associated with at least one urban core (urbanized area or urban cluster) of at least 10,000 population, plus adjacent counties having a high degree of social and economic integration with the core as measured through commuting ties with the counties containing the core. Categories of CBSAs are: Metropolitan Statistical Areas, based on urbanized areas of 50,000 or more population; and Micropolitan Statistical Areas, based on urban clusters of at least 10,000 population but less than 50,000 population. The CBSA boundaries are those defined by OMB based on the 2010 Census, published in 2013, and updated in 2018.",

These boundary files are specifically designed for small-scale thematic mapping. When possible, generalization is performed with the intent to maintain the hierarchical relationships among geographies and to maintain the alignment of geographies within a file set for a given year. Geographic areas may not align with the same areas from another year. Some geographies are available as nation-based files while others are available only as state-based files.\n\nA consolidated city is a unit of local government for which the functions of an incorporated place and its county or minor civil division (MCD) have merged. This action results in both the primary incorporated place and the county or MCD continuing to exist as legal entities, even though the county or MCD performs few or no governmental functions and has few or no elected officials. Where this occurs, and where one or more other incorporated places in the county or MCD continue to function as separate governments, even though they have been included in the consolidated government, the primary incorporated place is referred to as a consolidated city. The Census Bureau classifies the separately incorporated places within the consolidated city as place entities and creates a separate place (balance) record for the portion of the consolidated city not within any other place.\n\nThe generalized boundaries of the consolidated cities in this file are based on those as of January 1, 2020, as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).",

    "description": "This dataset of U.S. mortality trends since 1900 highlights trends in age-adjusted death rates for five selected major causes of death.\n\nAge-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000) after 1998 are calculated based on the 2000 U.S. standard population. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011–2017 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2010. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years between 2000 and 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published. Data on age-adjusted death rates prior to 1999 are taken from historical data (see References below).\n\nRevisions to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) over time may result in discontinuities in cause-of-death trends.\n\nSOURCES\n\nCDC/NCHS, National Vital Statistics System, historical data, 1900-1998 (see https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/mortality_historical_data.htm); CDC/NCHS, National Vital Statistics System, mortality data (see http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/deaths.htm); and CDC WONDER (see http://wonder.cdc.gov).\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.

    "description": "The 1995 American Travel Survey (ATS) was conducted by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) to obtain information about the long-distance travel of persons living in the United States. The survey collected quarterly information related to the characteristics of persons, households, and trips of 100 miles or more for approximately 80,000 American households. The ATS data provide detailed information on state-to-state travel as well as travel to and from metropolitan areas by mode of transportation. Data are also available for subgroups defined in terms of characteristics related to travel, such as trip purpose, age, family type, income, and a variety of related characteristics. The data can be analyzed at the regional, state, metropolitan area, and county level. NOTE: In 2001, the National Household Travel Survey was carried out. This new survey is a combined Nationwide Personal Transportation Survey (NPTS) and ATS. Visit the National Household Travel Survey web site << https://nhts.ornl.gov/ >> for more details.",

    "title": "Generative COMET v0.0.0",
    "description": "The United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) conducts extensive research to enhance the scientific foundation for national environmental decision-making. In this context, US EPA has developed COMET (City-based Optimization Model for Energy Technologies) to capture the whole energy system at the city level over a user-defined analyses timeline, from the extraction of primary resources to conversion into useful energy to meet end-use service demands. COMET accounts for the investment and operation costs, as well as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and other air pollutants, of alternative technology pathways meeting long-term energy demands in the buildings, transportation, and waste sectors. In this way, COMET enables users to explore, compare, and optimize energy technology solutions over the coming decades, especially for medium- and large-sized cities working to achieve energy optimization objectives and emissions reduction targets. Model results reveal how the energy system can be balanced under different scenarios and assumptions, as well as how system costs and emissions change with respect to those scenarios. With this information, city officials and their stakeholders working to pursue energy planning within their borders are positioned to make more informed policy and program decisions.\n\nAn open-source version of COMET designed for use by local planning, energy, or environmental agencies in any city is developed – will be called “Generative COMET”. The Generative COMET model incorporates innovative features that streamline the calibration process to align with official energy or GHG inventories, based on the level of detail available in city-level data. It provides cities with a versatile framework for analyzing energy and GHG emission scenarios, with different levels of data granularity and city-specific conditions. Its modular and adaptable structure enables cities of all sizes to explore customized strategies for meeting energy demands and achieving GHG reduction targets effectively. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nKaplan, O., K. Vaillancourt, M. Pied, R. Chaffanjon, F. Pedroli, D. Cooley, and N. Dietsch. Generative City-based Optimization Model for Energy Technologies: COMET Documentation and User Guide.

    "description": "Congress passed the National Flood Insurance Act (NFIA), 42 U.S.C. 4001 in 1968, creating the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) in order to reduce future flood losses through flood hazard identification, manage floodplain, and provide insurance protection. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) originally administered the NFIP, and Congress subsequently transferred the NFIP to FEMA upon its creation in 1979. FEMA and insurance companies participating in FEMA's Write Your Own (WYO) program offer NFIP insurance coverage for building structures as well as for contents and personal property within the building structures, to eligible and insurable properties. The WYO program began in 1983 with NFIP operating under Part B of the NFIA and allows FEMA to authorize private insurance companies to issue the Standard Flood Insurance Policy (SFIP) as FEMA's fiduciary and fiscal agent. FEMA administers NFIP by ensuring insurance applications are processed properly; determining correct premiums; renewing, reforming, and cancelling insurance policies; transferring policies from the seller of the property to the purchaser of the property in certain circumstances; and processing insurance claims. rnrnThe paid premiums of SFIPs and claims payments for damaged property are processed through the National Flood Insurance Fund (NFIF). NFIF was established by the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4001, et seq.), and is a centralized premium revenue and fee-generated fund that supports NFIP, which holds these U.S. Treasury funds. rnrnThis dataset is derived from the NFIP system of record, staged in the NFIP reporting platform and redacted to protect policy holder personally identifiable information.rnrnThe NFIP Transactional Record Reporting Process (TRRP) Plan (https://nfipservices.floodsmart.gov/manuals/jan_2015_consolidated_trrp.pdf ) defines for the WYO companies how to report policy and claims information to the NFIP. The Flood Insurance Manual (https://nfipservices.floodsmart.gov/home/manuals ) establishes how claims should be adjusted. The NFIP has provided answers to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) to assist the public in understanding and navigating the data our program makes available:  https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fema_nfip-data-faqs.pdfrnrnThis dataset represents more than 2,000,000 claims transactions, in order to improve accessibility, we have one compressed file. Due to the file size we recommend using Access, SQL, or another programming/data management tool to visualize and manipulate the data, as Excel will not be able to process files this large without data loss. The dataset will be updated approximately monthly and will have a lag with the system of record. rn rnThis dataset is not intended to be an official federal report and should not be considered an official federal report. rn rnCitation: The Agency's preferred citation for datasets (API usage or file downloads) can be found on the OpenFEMA Terms and Conditions page, Citing Data section: https://www.fema.gov/about/openfema/terms-conditions.rnrnIf you have media inquiries about this dataset, please email the FEMA News Desk at FEMA-News-Desk@fema.dhs.gov or call (202) 646-3272.

    "description": "The Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) is a computerized information database designed to support the FDA's post-marketing safety surveillance program for all approved drug and therapeutic biologic products. The FDA uses AERS to monitor for new adverse events and medication errors that might occur with these marketed products. Reporting of adverse events from the point of care is voluntary in the United States. FDA receives some adverse event and medication error reports directly from health care professionals (such as physicians, pharmacists, nurses and others) and consumers (such as patients, family members, lawyers and others). Healthcare professionals and consumers may also report these events to the products' manufacturers. If a manufacturer receives an adverse event report, it is required to send the report to FDA as specified by regulations.  The files listed on this page contain raw data extracted from the AERS database for the indicated time ranges and are not cumulative. Users of these files need to be familiar with creation of relational databases using applications such as ORACLE, Microsoft Office Access, MySQL and IBM DB2 or the use of ASCII files with SAS analytic tools. A simple search of AERS data cannot be performed with these files by persons who are not familiar with creation of relational databases.",

This 14-day lag allows case reporting to be stabilized and ensures that time-dependent outcome data are accurately captured.<br>\n- Datasets are updated monthly. <br>\n- Datasets are created using CDC’s operational Policy on Public Health Research and Nonresearch Data Management and Access and include protections designed to protect individual privacy.<br>\n- For more information about data collection and reporting, please see <a href=\"https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-collection.html\"> https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-collection.html</a><br>\n- For more information about the COVID-19 case surveillance data, please see <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/faq-surveillance.html\"> https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/faq-surveillance.html</a><br>\n\n<h4><b>Overview</b></h4>\n\nThe COVID-19 case surveillance database includes individual-level data reported to U.S. states and autonomous reporting entities, including New York City and the District of Columbia (D.C.), as well as U.S. territories and affiliates.

CSTE updated the position statement on August 5, 2020 to clarify the interpretation of antigen detection tests and serologic test results within the case classification. The statement also recommended that all states and territories enact laws to make COVID-19 reportable in their jurisdiction, and that jurisdictions conducting surveillance should submit case notifications to CDC.

By publishing U.S. foreign assistance data that is accurate and timely, ForeignAssistance.gov presents a multi-dimensional picture of the U.S. foreign assistance lifecycle in a highly visual, interactive website.  The eight datasets herein are regularly updated on an approximate monthly basis.\n\nDesigned to engage users across a wide range of backgrounds and levels of expertise, ForeignAssistance.gov empowers users to explore U.S. foreign assistance data through visualizations such as heatmaps, trends, bar charts, tree maps, and other graphs, while also providing the flexibility for users to create custom queries, download data, and conduct analyses by country, sector, or agency. Additionally, with the Development Cooperation Landscape dashboard, users may explore development activities in a country beyond what is provided by the U.S. government, as reported to the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI).\n\nForeignAssistance.gov collects and publishes foreign assistance data as reported by more than 20 U.S. government agencies that manage foreign assistance programs. In doing so, ForeignAssistance.gov fulfills aid transparency standards and reporting requirements, including the Foreign Aid Transparency and Accountability Act of 2016 (FATAA), Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act, and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Bulletin 12-01.     \n\nThe new, consolidated ForeignAssistance.gov is a product of the Foreign Assistance Data and Reporting Team (FA-DART), a joint initiative by the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development.",

GDAS adds the following types of observations to a gridded, 3-D, model space: surface observations, balloon data, wind profiler data, aircraft reports, buoy observations, radar observations, and satellite observations. GDAS data are available as both input observations to GDAS and gridded output fields from GDAS. Gridded GDAS output data can be used to start the GFS model. Due to the diverse nature of the assimilated data types, input data are available in a variety of data formats, primarily Binary Universal Form for the Representation of meteorological data (BUFR) and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) binary. The GDAS output is World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Gridded Binary (GRIB).",

The dataset is primarily based on the output of a regional climate model (RCM), i.e., the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model version 3.3.1. The WRF simulations are driven by the output of a general circulation model (GCM), i.e., the Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4).\n\nThis dataset is in the EPW format, which can be read or translated by more than 25 building energy modeling programs (e.g., EnergyPlus, ESP-r, and IESVE), energy system modeling programs (e.g., System Advisor Model (SAM)), indoor air quality analysis programs (e.g., CONTAM), and hygrothermal analysis programs (e.g., WUFI). It contains 13 weather variables, which are the Dry-Bulb Temperature, Dew Point Temperature, Relative Humidity, Atmospheric Pressure, Horizontal Infrared Radiation Intensity from Sky, Global Horizontal Irradiation, Direct Normal Irradiation, Diffuse Horizontal Irradiation, Wind Speed, Wind Direction, Sky Cover, Albedo, and Liquid Precipitation Depth.\n\nThis dataset provides future weather data under two emissions scenarios - RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 - across two 10-year periods (2045-2054 and 2085-2094). It also includes simulated historical weather data for 1995-2004 to serve as the baseline for climate impact assessments. We strongly recommend using this built-in baseline rather than external sources (e.g., TMY3) for two key reasons: (1) it shares the same model grid as the future projections, thereby minimizing geographic-averaging bias, and (2) both historical and future datasets were generated by the same RCM, so their differences yield anomalies largely free of residual model bias.\n \nThis dataset offers a spatial resolution of 12 km by 12 km with extensive coverage across most of North America. Due to the enormous size of the entire dataset, in the first stage of its distribution, we provide weather data for the centroid of each Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA), excluding Hawaii. PUMAs are non-overlapping, statistical geographic areas that partition each state or equivalent entity into geographic areas containing no fewer than 100,000 people each. The 2,378 PUMAs as a whole cover the entirety of the U.S. The weather data can be utilized alongside the large-scale energy analysis tools, ResStock and ComStock, developed by National Renewable Energy Laboratory, whose smallest resolution is at the PUMA scale.\n\nThe authors observed an anomalous warming signal over the Great Plains in the end-of-century (2085 - 2094) RCP4.5 time slice. This anomaly is absent in the mid-century slice (2045 - 2054) under RCP4.5 and in both the mid- (2045 - 2054) and end-of-century (2085 - 2094) slices under RCP8.5. Consequently, we recommend that users exercise particular caution when using the RCP4.5 2085-2094 data, especially for analyses involving the Great Plains region.",

    "title": "Hourly Dynamic Line Ratings for Existing Transmission Across the Contiguous United States (Preliminary)",
    "description": "This dataset provides estimated hourly dynamic line ratings for ~84,000 transmission lines across the contiguous United States from 2007-2013. The calculation methods are described in the presentation linked below, and the associated open-source Python code repository is linked in the Resources section below.\n\nAbbreviations used in filenames and descriptions are:\n- SLR: static line ratings\n- ALR: ambient-temperature-adjusted line ratings\n- NLR: ambient-temperature- and day/night-irradiance-adjusted line ratings\n- CLR: ambient-temperature- and clear-sky-irradiance-adjusted line ratings\n- ILR: ambient-temperature- and measured-irradiance-adjusted line ratings\n- DLR: full dynamic line ratings (including air temperature/pressure, wind speed/direction, and measured irradiance)\n\nTransmission lines are referenced by their ID in the Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) on Transmission Lines (linked in Resources section). Time indices are in UTC. The data files contain ratios between modeled hourly ratings and modeled static ratings. Columns are indexed by HIFLD ID; rows are indexed by hourly timestamps from 2007-2013 (UTC). A data directory is also included in the Resources section.\n\nThe SLR files contain modeled static ratings (the denominator of the ratios in the files described above) in amps. As described in the presentation linked in the Resources section below, SLR calculations assume an ambient air temperature of 40 C, air pressure of 101 kPa, wind speed of 2 feet per second (0.61 m/s) perpendicular to the conductor, global horizontal irradiance of 1000 W/m^2, and conductor absorptivity and emissivity of 0.8. Conductor assumptions are Linnet for ~69 kV and below, Condor for ~115 kV, Martin for ~230 kV, and Cardinal for ~345 kV and above.\n\nCaveats and Limitations\n----------------------------\nResults are sensitive to the weather data used. Validation studies on the WIND Toolkit and NSRDB are available at:\n- King, J. et al. \"Validation of Power Output for the WIND Toolkit\", 2014 (https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy14osti/61714.pdf)\n- Draxl, C. et al. \"Overview and Meteorological Validation of the Wind Integration National Dataset Toolkit\", 2015 (https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy15osti/61740.pdf)\n- Sengupta, M. et al. \"Validation of the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) (2005-2012)\", 2015 (https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy15osti/64981.pdf)\n- Habte, A. et al. \"Evaluation of the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB Version 2): 1998-2015\", 2017 (https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy17osti/67722.pdf)\n\nMore work is required to determine how well ratings calculated from NSRDB and WIND Toolkit data reflect the actual ratings observed by installed sensors (such as sag or tension monitors). In general, ratings calculated from modeled weather data are not a substitute for direct sensor data.\n\nAssuming a single representative conductor type (ACSR of a single diameter) for each voltage level is an important simplification; reported line ratings at a given voltage level can vary widely.\n\nHIFLD line routes are primarily based on imagery instead of exact construction data and may have errors.\n\nWe use historical weather data directly; calculated line ratings are thus more indicative of real-time ratings than forecasted ratings",

    "description": "OAR's RACT, BACT, LAER Clearinghouse (RBLC) data asset contains summary information on selected air permitting actions from EPA, state, and local permitting agencies across the U.S., as well as a number of international permit records supplied by air pollution control agencies in Mexico and Canada. The acronyms refer to program requirements of the New Source Review (NSR) program: RACT is Reasonably Available Control Technology and applies to existing sources in areas that are not meeting national ambient air quality standards (i.e., non-attainment areas); BACT is Best Available Control Technology and applies to major new or modified sources in clean areas (i.e., attainment areas). LAER, or Lowest Achievable Emission Rate, is required on major new or modified sources in non-attainment areas. As of 2012, RBLC includes approximately 6,500 entries. With the exception of LAER permit determinations, whose inclusion in RBLC is mandatory, participation is voluntary. Coverage is therefore not complete or necessarily representative.Required under Section 108 of the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act, RBLC provides users â?? typically permit writers, permit applicants or holders, and the public â?? with references and personal contacts to support ongoing air pollution control activities. Information is detailed enough for users to know whether a permit is applicable to their needs. Users may then contact the appropriate agency to access the permit or discuss it with agency staff.RBLC-referenced permits cover Criteria Air Pollutants (CAPs) and Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs), but the data is also searchable for Greenhouse Gas (GHG) references. Entries are generally provided by the original permitting agency, though EPA Regional Offices may enter data on behalf of state and local agencies to augment coverage. Since 2009, Canadian and Mexican agencies have had access to the RBLC to submit their own permit information; all data is provided in English.There are three main levels of information â?? Facility, Process, and Pollutant. Facility Data includes but is not limited to: Facility Name, City/Town, State, Permitting Agency, Permit Date, NAICS, SIC, Facility Registry System Number, Permit Number, and Agency Contact Name & Phone Number. Process Data includes but is not limited to: Process Name, Process Type Code, and Throughput. Pollutant Data includes but is not limited to: Pollutant Name, CAS#, Emissions Testing Method(s), Emission Limits, Case-by-Case Basis and any Other Applicable Requirements; and Control Method Description. U.S. geographic coverage includes all states and territories, plus all U.S. permitted facilities within U.S. waters (generally 3 miles for state limits, but further offshore for DOI-permitted oil platforms). Coverage began in 1980, but some historical permits from the 1970s are included. Over the years the data has been converted from paper to searchable digital form. Data is not overwritten, so multiple historical permit references for a single facility may be included. OAQPS manually cross-references RBLC references to the appropriate Facility Registry System (FRS) ID to the extent possible. All RBLC content is public and non-sensitive and available through EPA.gov after it has been quality assured. Data is quality assured by EPA and entered into the RACT, BACT, LAER Clearinghouse (RBLC) data management system (https://cfpub.epa.gov/rblc/index.cfm?action=Home.Home). Where technical summaries appear inaccurate, OAQPS returns entries for review to their originators. All data is edited and approved by the Office of Air and Radiationâ??s Office of Air Quality Permits and Standards (OAQPS) prior to publication.",

These factors took into account electricity imports and exports across the eGRID subregion boundary, and included estimated transmission and distribution (T) losses.  Emission types accounted for included carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and sulfur dioxide (SO2).Data reported as part of this project include hourly average, minimum, and maximum emission factors by month; that is, the average, minimum, and maximum emission factor for the same hour of each day in a month. Please note that the data are reported in lbs/MWh, where the MWh value reported is site electricity use (the actual electricity used at the building) and the pounds of emissions reported are the emissions created at the generator to meet the building load, including transmission and distribution losses. The demand profiles used to generate the data pertain to the following years: eastern interconnect - 2005; Electricity Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) - 2008; Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) - 2008.",

    "title": "Daily Weather Records",
    "description": "These daily weather records were compiled from a subset of stations in the Global Historical Climatological Network (GHCN)-Daily dataset. A weather record is considered broken if the value exceeds the maximum (or minimum) value recorded for an eligible station. A weather record is considered tied if the value is the same as the maximum (or minimum) value recorded for an eligible station. Daily weather parameters include Highest Min/Max Temperature, Lowest Min/Max Temperature, Highest Precipitation, Highest Snowfall and Highest Snow Depth. All stations meet defined eligibility criteria. For this application, a station is defined as the complete daily weather records at a particular location, having a unique identifier in the GHCN-Daily dataset. For a station to be considered for any weather parameter, it must have a minimum of 30 years of data with more than 182 days complete in each year. This is effectively a 30-year record of service requirement, but allows for inclusion of some stations which routinely shut down during certain seasons. Small station moves, such as a move from one property to an adjacent property, may occur within a station history. However, larger moves, such as a station moving from downtown to the city airport, generally result in the commissioning of a new station identifier. This tool treats each of these histories as a different station. In this way, it does not thread the separate histories into one record for a city. Records Timescales are characterized in three ways. In order of increasing noteworthiness, they are Daily Records, Monthly Records and All Time Records. For a given station, Daily Records refers to the specific calendar day: (e.g., the value recorded on March 7th compared to every other March 7th). Monthly Records exceed all values observed within the specified month (e.g., the value recorded on March 7th compared to all values recorded in every March). All-Time Records exceed the record of all observations, for any date, in a station's period of record. The Date Range and Location features are used to define the time and location ranges which are of interest to the user. For example, selecting a date range of March 1, 2012 through March 15, 2012 will return a list of records broken or tied on those 15 days. The Location Category and Country menus allow the user to define the geographic extent of the records of interest. For example, selecting Oklahoma will narrow the returned list of records to those that occurred in the state of Oklahoma, USA. The number of records broken for several recent periods is summarized in the table and updated daily. Due to late-arriving data, the number of recent records is likely underrepresented in all categories, but the ratio of records (warm to cold, for example) should be a fairly strong estimate of a final outcome. There are many more precipitation stations than temperature stations, so the raw number of precipitation records will likely exceed the number of temperature records in most climatic situations.",

For clarity, they are listed below along with the aquifer unit or confining unit name \nin North Carolina and its correlated unit name in South Carolina. \n\t\t\t\nL1 \tSurficial aquifer \nL2 \tYorktown confining unit / Upper Floridan confining unit \nL3 \tYorktown aquifer / Upper Floridan aquifer \nL4 \tCastle Hayne - Pungo River confining unit / Middle Floridan confining unit \n\t(To be referred to as \"Castle Hayne / Middle Floridan confining unit\" in this document) \nL5 \tCastle Hayne - Pungo River aquifer / Middle Floridan aquifer \n\t(To be referred to as \"Castle Hayne - Middle Floridan aquifer\" in this document) \nL6 \tBeaufort confing unit / Gordon confining unit \nL7 \tBeaufort aquifer / Gordon aquifer \nL8 \tPeedee confining unit / Crouch Branch confining unit \nL9 \tPeedee aquifer / Crouch Branch aquifer \nL10 \tBlack Creek confining unit / McQueen Branch confining unit \nL11 \tBlack Creek aquifer / McQueen Branch aquifer \nL12 \tUpper Cape Fear confining unit / Charleston confining unit \nL13 \tUpper Cape Fear aquifer / Charleston aquifer \nL14 \tLower Cape Fear confining unit / Gramling confining unit \nL15 \tLower Cape Fear aquifer / Gramling aquifer \nL16 \tLower Cretaceous confining unit and aquifer \n\t\t\t\nSpatial data set pp1773_layer1_extent represents the extent of the top of the surficial aquifer, \nwhich is Layer 1 in the groundwater model used to simulate the aquifer system described in \nPP 1773. The surficial aquifer is the uppermost aquifer. It is an unconfined aquifer that is \nuniformly present except where it is incised by streams. The top of the surficial aquifer is \nequivalent to the land surface. The extent was derived primarily by geologic and hydraulic \nproperties, as the surficial aquifer is an unconfined layer primarily composed of sediments \nof Quaternary age, plus some older sediments in areas due to a different stratigraphic \nposition of the first underlying confining layer. \n\t\t\t\nSpatial data set pp_1773_layer_2 is the Yorktown/Upper Floridan confining unit. It is not \ncomposed of a single unit because the unit's series of clay and silt beds vary greatly in \nstratigraphic position. \n\t\t\t\nSpatial dataset pp1773_layer3_extent represents the extent of the Yorktown/Upper Floridan \naquifer. The Yorktown aquifer is present only in the northern half of the North Carolina Coastal \nPlain. Outliers exist in Robeson, Bladen and Dublin counties, but are not separated from the \nsurficial aquifer by a confining unit, and not considered a distinct aquifer in these areas. The \nUpper Floridan aquifer extent covers a southern portion of South Carolina and southern portion \nof Georgia. \n\t\t\t\nSpatial dataset pp1773_layer4_extent represents the extent of the Castle Hayne/Middle Floridan \nconfining unit. The Castle Hayne confining unit consists of beds of clay and silt that vary in \nstratigraphic position and are absent in a number of areas in the central and southern North \nCarolina Coastal Plain. The Middle Floridan confining unit extends from South Carolina to \nsouthern Georgia. It is not continuous with the Castle Hayne confining unit. \n\t\t\t\nSpatial dataset pp1773_layer5_extent represents the extent of the Castle Hayne/Middle \nFloridan aquifer. The Castle Hayne aquifer is located in the central and southern North Carolina \nCoastal Plain; the Middle Floridan aquifer is more south, in southern South Carolina and southern \nGeorgia. \n\t\t\t\nSpatial dataset pp1773_layer6_extent represents the extent of the Beaufort/Gordon confining unit. \nThe Beaufort confining unit is located in northeastern North Carolina and southeastern Virginia. \nIt is best developed in North Carolina, and contains areas where it has eroded or pinches out. \nThe Gordon confining unit is located in southern South Carolina and southeastern Georgia. \n\t\t\t\nSpatial dataset pp1773_layer7_extent represents the extent of the Beaufort/Gordon aquifer unit. \nThe Beaufort aquifer, in northeastern North Carolina and southeastern Virginia, and the Gordon \naquifer, in southeastern South Carolina and southeastern Georgia, are not continuous or \nhydraulically connected. \n\t\t\t\nSpatial dataset pp1773_layer8_extent represents the extent of the Peedee/Crouch Branch \nconfining unit. The Peedee/Crouch Branch confining unit is positioned stratigraphically near \nthe contact of the Paleocene Beaufort and Late Cretaceous Peedee Formations in the eastern \nNorth Carolina Coastal Plain, from southeastern North Carolina down to southern Georgia. \n\t\t\t\nSpatial dataset pp1773_layer9_extent represents the extent of the Peedee/Crouch Branch \naquifer. The Peedee/Crouch Branch aquifer is positioned in southeastern North Carolina, \nencompasses all of the Atlantic Coastal Plain in South Carolina, and parts of southeastern \nGeorgia. \n\t\t\t\nSpatial dataset pp1773_layer10_extent represents the extent of the Black Creek/McQueen \nBranch confining unit. The areal extent of this unit includes much of North Carolina within the \nAtlantic Coastal Plain, all of South Carolina within the Atlantic Coastal Plain, and a region in \nsoutheast Georgia within the Atlantic Coastal Plain. \n\t\t\t\nSpatial dataset pp1773_layer11_extent represents the extent of the Black Creek/McQueen \nBranch aquifer. The areal extent of this unit includes northeastern parts of North Carolina \nwithin the Atlantic Coastal Plain, most South Carolina within the Atlantic Coastal Plain, \nand a region in southeast Georgia within the Atlantic Coastal Plain. Black Creek and \nMcQueen Branch aquifers are hydraulically connected. \n\t\t\t\nSpatial dataset pp1773_layer12_extent represents the extent of the Upper Cape Fear/Charleston \nconfining unit. The areal extent of this unit includes a small area in southeastern Virginia, much of \nNorth Carolina within the Atlantic Coastal Plain, part of South Carolina within the Atlantic Coastal \nPlain, and a region in southeast Georgia within the Atlantic Coastal Plain. \n\t\t\t\nSpatial dataset pp1773_layer13_extent represents the extent of the Upper Cape Fear/Charleston \naquifer unit. The areal extent of this unit includes a small area in southeastern Virginia, much of North \nCarolina within the Atlantic Coastal Plain, part of South Carolina within the Atlantic Coastal Plain, and \na region in southeast Georgia within the Atlantic Coastal Plain. Upper Cape Fear and Charleston aquifer \nunits are hydraulically connected. \n\t\t\t\nSpatial dataset pp1773_layer14_extent represents the extent of the Lower Cape Fear/Gramling confining \nunit. The areal extent of this unit includes a small area in southeastern Virginia, much of North Carolina \nwithin the Atlantic Coastal Plain, part of South Carolina within the Atlantic Coastal Plain, and a region in \nsoutheast Georgia within the Atlantic Coastal Plain. \n\t\t\t\nSpatial dataset pp1773_layer15_extent represents the extent of the Lower Cape Fear/Gramling aquifer unit. \nThe areal extent of this unit includes a small area in southeastern Virginia, much of North Carolina within the \nAtlantic Coastal Plain, part of South Carolina within the Atlantic Coastal Plain, and a region in southeast \nGeorgia within the Atlantic Coastal Plain. Lower Cape Fear/Gramling aquifer units are hydraulically connected. \n\t\t\t\nSpatial dataset pp1773_layer16_extent represents the extent of the Lower Cretaceous aquifer unit. The areal \nextent of this unit includes a small area in southeastern Virginia and northeastern North Carolina within the \nAtlantic Coastal Plain. Based on available information, it is not possible to determine the position and extent \nof an intervening confining unit between the Lower Cape Fear and Lower Cretaceous aquifers.",

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. \n Face refers to the areal (polygon) topological primitives that make up MTDB. A face is bounded by one or more edges; its boundary includes only the edges that separate it from other faces, not any interior edges contained within the area of the face. The Topological Faces Shapefile contains the attributes of each topological primitive face. Each face has a unique topological face identifier (TFID) value. Each face in the shapefile includes the key geographic area codes for all geographic areas for which the Census Bureau tabulates data for both the 2020 Census and the annual estimates and surveys. The geometries of each of these geographic areas can then be built by dissolving the face geometries on the appropriate key geographic area codes in the Topological Faces Shapefile.",

In 2012, the Census Bureau obtained the inventory and boundaries of most military installations from the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) for Air Force, Army, Marine, and Navy installations and from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for Coast Guard installations. \n\n\nThe military installation boundaries in this release represent the updates the Census Bureau made in 2012 in collaboration with DoD.\n",

The information was prepared by digitizing maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using remotely sensed and other information. This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute data. The map data are in a soil survey area extent format and include a detailed, field verified inventory of soils and miscellaneous areas that normally occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped. A special soil features layer (point and line features) is optional. This layer displays the location of features too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil Information System relational database, which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.</span></p></div></div></div>",

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.\nThe American Indian/Alaska Native/Native Hawaiian (AIANNH) Areas Shapefile includes the following legal entities: federally recognized American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust land areas, state-recognized American Indian reservations, and Hawaiian home lands (HHLs).  The statistical entities included are Alaska Native village statistical areas (ANVSAs), Oklahoma tribal statistical areas (OTSAs), tribal designated statistical areas (TDSAs), and state designated tribal statistical areas (SDTSAs).  Joint use areas are also included in this shapefile refer to areas that are administered jointly and/or claimed by two or more American Indian tribes.  The Census Bureau designates both legal and statistical joint use areas as unique geographic entities for the purpose of presenting statistical data.  Note that tribal subdivisions and Alaska Native Regional Corporations (ANRCs) are additional types of American Indian/Alaska Native areas stored by the Census Bureau, but are displayed in separate shapefiles because of how they fall within the Census Bureau's geographic hierarchy.\nThe State of Hawaii's Office of Hawaiian Home Lands provides the legal boundaries for the HHLs. The boundaries for ANVSAs, OTSAs, and TDSAs were delineated for the 2020 Census through the Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP) by participants from the federally recognized tribal governments.  The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) within the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) provides the list of federally recognized tribes and only provides legal boundary information when the tribes need supporting records, if a boundary is based on treaty or another document that is historical or open to legal interpretation, or when another tribal, state, or local government challenges the depiction of a reservation or off-reservation trust land.\nThe boundaries for federally recognized American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands are as of January 1, 2023, as reported by the federally recognized tribal governments through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).\nThe boundaries for state-recognized American Indian reservations and for SDTSAs were delineated by a state governor-appointed liaisons for the 2020 Census through the State American Indian Reservation Program and PSAP respectively.",

HUD’s Multifamily Housing property portfolio consist primarily of rental housing properties with five or more dwelling units such as apartments or town houses, but can also include nursing homes, hospitals, elderly housing, mobile home parks, retirement service centers, and occasionally vacant land. HUD provides subsidies and grants to property owners and developers in an effort to promote the development and preservation of affordable rental units for low-income populations, and those with special needs such as the elderly, and disabled. The portfolio can be broken down into two basic categories: insured, and assisted. The three largest assistance programs for Multifamily Housing are Section 8 Project Based Assistance, Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly, and Section 811 Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities.  The Multifamily property locations represent the approximate location of the property. The locations of individual buildings associated with each property are not depicted here.",

    "description": "Overall attendance data include students in Districts 1-32 and 75 (Special Education). Students in District 79 (Alternative Schools & Programs), charter schools, home schooling, and home and hospital instruction are excluded. Pre-K data do not include NYC Early Education Centers or District Pre-K Centers; therefore, Pre-K data are limited to those who attend K-12 schools that offer Pre-K. Transfer schools are included in citywide, borough, and district counts but removed from school-level files.\nAttendance is attributed to the school the student attended at the time. If a student attends multiple schools in a school year, the student will contribute data towards multiple schools.\nStarting in 2020-21, the NYC DOE transitioned to NYSED's definition of chronic absenteeism. Students are considered chronically absent if they have an attendance of 90 percent or less (i.e. students who are absent 10 percent or more of the total days). In order to be included in chronic absenteeism calculations, students must be enrolled for at least 10 days (regardless of whether present or absent) and must have been present for at least 1 day. The NYSED chronic absenteeism definition is applied to all prior years in the report.\nSchool-level chronic absenteeism data reflect chronic absenteeism at a particular school. In order to eliminate double-counting students in chronic absenteeism counts, calculations at the district, borough, and citywide levels include all attendance data that contribute to the given geographic category. For example, if a student was chronically absent at one school but not at another, the student would only be counted once in the citywide calculation. For this reason, chronic absenteeism counts will not align across files.\nAll demographic data are based on a student's most recent record in a given year.\nStudents With Disabilities (SWD) data do not include Pre-K students since Pre-K students are screened for IEPs only at the parents' request.\nEnglish language learner (ELL) data do not include Pre-K students since the New York State Education Department only begins administering assessments to be identified as an ELL in Kindergarten.\nOnly grades PK-12 are shown, but calculations for \"All Grades\" also include students missing a grade level, so PK-12 may not add up to \"All Grades\". \nData include students missing a gender, but are not shown due to small cell counts.\nData for Asian students include Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islanders . Multi-racial and Native American students, as well as students missing ethnicity/race data are included in the \"Other\" ethnicity category.\nIn order to comply with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) regulations on public reporting of education outcomes, rows with five or fewer students are suppressed, and have been replaced with an \"s\". Using total days of attendance as a proxy , rows with 900 or fewer total days are suppressed. In addition, other rows have been replaced with an \"s\" when they could reveal, through addition or subtraction, the underlying numbers that have been redacted. Chronic absenteeism values are suppressed, regardless of total days, if the number of students who contribute  at least 20 days is five or fewer. \nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting shift to remote learning in March 2020, 2019-20 attendance data was only available for September 2019 through March 13, 2020. Interactions data from the spring of 2020 are reported on a separate tab.\nInteractions were reported by schools during remote learning, from April 6 2020 through June 26 2020 (a total of 57 instructional days, excluding special professional development days of June 4 and June 9). Schools were required to indicate any student from their roster that did not have an interaction on a given day. Schools were able to define interactions in a way that made sense for their students and families. Definitions of an interaction included:\n• Student submission of an assignment or completion of an",

The datasets can be used by users (e.g., software developers, data scientists) who work on robot health management (including accuracy) but have limited or no access to robots that can capture real data. The datasets can support the:\n\n- Development of robot health monitoring algorithms and tools\n- Research of technologies and tools to support robot monitoring, diagnostics, prognostics, and health management (collectively called PHM)\n- Validation and verification of the industrial PHM implementation. For example, the verification of a robot's TCP accuracy after the work cell has been reconfigured, or whenever a manufacturer wants to determine if the robot arm has experienced a degradation.\n\nFor data collection, a trajectory is programmed for the Universal Robot (UR5) approaching and stopping at randomly-selected locations in its workspace. The robot moves along this preprogrammed trajectory during different conditions of temperature, payload, and speed. The TCP (x,y,z) of the robot are measured by a 7-D measurement system developed at NIST. Differences are calculated between the measured positions from the 7-D measurement system and the nominal positions calculated by the nominal robot kinematic parameters. The results are recorded within the dataset. Controller level sensing data are also collected from each joint (direct output from the controller of the UR5), to understand the influences of position degradation from temperature, payload, and speed. Controller-level data can be used for the root cause analysis of the robot performance degradation, by providing joint positions, velocities, currents, accelerations, torques, and temperatures. For example, the cold-start temperatures of the six joints were approximately 25 degrees Celsius. After two hours of operation, the joint temperatures increased to approximately 35 degrees Celsius. Control variables are listed in the header file in the data set (UR5TestResult_header.xlsx). \n\nIf you'd like to comment on this data and/or offer recommendations on future datasets, please email guixiu.qiao@nist.gov.",

    "title": "Estimated annual agricultural pesticide use by major crop or crop group for states of the conterminous United States, 1992-2019 (including preliminary estimates for 2018-19)",
    "description": "This data release provides state-level estimates of annual agricultural use of pesticide compounds by major crop or crop group for states in the conterminous United States, for years 1992-2019, compiled from data used to make county-level estimates by means of methods described in Thelin and Stone (2013) and Baker and Stone (2015). The source of these data is the same as the published county-level pesticide-use estimates for 1992-2009 (Stone, 2013), estimates for 2008-2012 (Baker and Stone, 2015), estimates for 2013-17 (Wieben, 2019), and preliminary estimates for 2018 and 2019 (Wieben, 2021a, Wieben, 2021b, respectively). County-level by-crop estimates are not published because of the increased uncertainty in estimating the geographic distribution of compounds applied to specific crops. High-acreage crops (corn, soybeans, wheat, cotton, rice, and alfalfa) are individually aggregated to state level while low-acreage crops are combined into groups (vegetables and fruit, orchards and grapes, pasture and hay, and other crops) prior to aggregating to the state level.\nThis data release contains two tables of state-level annual agricultural pesticide-use estimates by crop or crop group (one for low estimates and one for high estimates) and associated metadata. These data were used to produce annual time-series charts for individual pesticide by crop or crop group for 1992-2019 available on the Pesticide National Synthesis Project webpage: https://doi.org/doi:10.5066/F7NP22KM. Beginning in 2019, estimates are reported for a reduced number of compounds.\nReferences cited:\nBaker, N.T., and Stone, W.W., 2015, Estimated annual agricultural pesticide use for counties of the conterminous United States, 2008-12: U.S. Geological Survey Data Series 907, 9 p., accessed July 12, 2015, at http://doi.org/10.3133/ds907.\nStone, W.W., 2013, Estimated annual agricultural pesticide use for counties of the conterminous United States, 1992-2009: U.S. Geological Survey Data Series 752, 1 p. pamphlet, 14 tables, accessed July 12, 2015, at http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/752/. \nThelin, G.P., and Stone, W.W., 2013, Estimation of annual agricultural pesticide use for counties of the conterminous United States, 1992-2009: U.S. Geological Survey Scientific Investigations Report 2013-5009, 54 p., accessed July 12, 2015, at http://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2013/5009/.\nWieben, C.M., 2019, Estimated annual agricultural pesticide use for counties of the conterminous United States, 2013-17 (ver. 2.0, May 2020): U.S. Geological Survey data release, accessed January 15, 2021, at https://doi.org/10.5066/P9F2SRYH.\nWieben, C.M., 2021a, Preliminary estimated annual agricultural pesticide use for counties of the conterminous United States, 2018: U.S. Geological Survey data release, https://doi.org/10.5066/P920L09S.\nWieben, C.M., 2021b, Preliminary estimated annual agricultural pesticide use for counties of the conterminous United States, 2019: U.S. Geological Survey data release, https://doi.org/10.5066/P9EDTHQL.",

As a broad racial category, Asian Americans are the fastest-growing minority group in the United States (U.S. Census Bureau, 2012). The growth rate of 42.9% in Asian Americans between 2000 and 2010 is phenomenal given that the corresponding figure for the U.S. total population is only 9.3% (see Figure 1). Currently, Asian Americans make up 5.6% of the total U.S. population and are projected to reach 10% by 2050. It is particularly notable that Asians have recently overtaken Hispanics as the largest group of new immigrants to the U.S. (Pew Research Center, 2015). The rapid growth rate and unique challenges as a new immigrant group call for a better understanding of the social and health needs of the Asian American population.",

The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB).  The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.\nCounty subdivisions are the primary divisions of counties and their equivalent entities for the reporting of Census Bureau data. They include legally-recognized minor civil divisions (MCDs) and statistical census county divisions (CCDs), and unorganized territories.  For the 2010 Census, the MCDs are the primary governmental and/or administrative divisions of counties in 29 States and Puerto Rico; Tennessee changed from having CCDs for Census 2000 to having MCDs for the 2010 Census.  In MCD States where no MCD exists or is not defined, the Census Bureau creates statistical unorganized territories to complete coverage.  The entire area of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas are covered by county subdivisions.\nThe boundaries of most legal MCDs are as of January 1, 2023, as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).  The boundaries of all CCDs are those as reported as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP) for the 2020 Census.",

PV modules are from fielded systems in Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA. Measurements of corresponding IV and EL data were taken over a 6 year period, with modules removed from the field and measured in the laboratory at 0 to 5 years of outdoor exposure. The 438 unique modules comprise 28 unique module models from 17 different brands, which are anonymized in the metadata. Additional metadata include current-voltage and electroluminescence acquisition parameters, and length of outdoor exposure.\n\nFor more metadata information see the AnonDB.csv file, which contains metadata for each module in the dataset, and provides information on each of the IV and EL measurements. Descriptions of each column in the AnonDB.csv file are listed under the \"AnonDB Descriptions\" resource linked below.\n\nThis project was funded under award \"PV Proving Grounds\" numbers 38268 and 52787.",

    "description": "The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB).  The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.\n\nThe primary legal divisions of most states are termed counties.  In Louisiana, these divisions are known as parishes.  In Alaska, which has no counties, the equivalent entities are the organized boroughs, city and boroughs, municipalities, and for the unorganized area, census areas.  The latter are delineated cooperatively for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau.  In four states (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia), there are one or more incorporated places that are independent of any county organization and thus constitute primary divisions of their states.  These incorporated places are known as independent cities and are treated as equivalent entities for purposes of data presentation.  The District of Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions, and each area is considered an equivalent entity for purposes of data presentation.  The Census Bureau treats the following entities as equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentation: Municipios in Puerto Rico, Districts and Islands in American Samoa, Municipalities in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Islands in the U.S. Virgin Islands.  The entire area of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas is covered by counties or equivalent entities.  \n\nThe boundaries for counties and equivalent entities are mostly as of January 1, 2021, as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).\n",

    "description": "Employee payroll data for all Cook County employees excluding Forest Preserves, indicating amount of base salary paid to an employee during the County fiscal quarter. Salaries are paid to employees on a bi-weekly basis. \r\nAny pay period that extended between quarters will be reported to the quarter of the Pay Period End Date.  (e.g. If a Pay Period runs 02/21-03/05, that pay period would be reported in the Q2 period, as the end of the pay period falls in March - Q2)\r\n\r\nThe county fiscal quarters are:\r\nQ1: December - February\r\nQ2: March - May\r\nQ3: June - August\r\nQ4: September - November\r\n\r\nThe Employee Unique Identifier field is a unique number assigned to each employee for the purpose of this data set, that is not their internal employee ID number, and allows an employee to be identified in the data set over time, in case of a name change or other change. This number will be consistent within the data set, but we reserve the right to regenerate this number over time across the data set.\r\n\r\nISSUE RESOLVED: As of 4/19/2018 there was an issue regarding employee FY2016 and FY2017 payroll in which records were duplicated in the quarterly aggregation, resulting in inflated base pay amounts. Please disregard any data extracted from this dataset prior to the correction date and use this version moving forward. \r\n\r\nKNOWN ISSUE: Several records are missing Bureau and Office information. We are working on correcting this and will update the dataset when this issue has been resolved.\r\n\r\nFor data prior to Fiscal Year 2016, see datasets at https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/browse?tags=payroll",

A Federal SMA Withdrawal is defined by formal actions that set aside, withhold, or reserve Federal land by statute or administrative order for public purposes. A withdrawal creates a title encumbrance on the land. Withdrawals must accomplish one or more of the following: A. Transfer total or partial jurisdiction of Federal land between Federal agencies. B. Close (segregate) Federal land to operation of all or some of the public land laws and/or mineral laws. C. Dedicate Federal land to a specific public purpose. There are four major categories of formal withdrawals: (1) Administrative, (2) Presidential Proclamations, (3) Congressional, and (4) Federal Power Act (FPA) or Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Withdrawals.

These data are from the 2013 California Dietary Practices Surveys (CDPS), 2012 California Teen Eating, Exercise and Nutrition Survey (CalTEENS), and 2013 California Children’s Healthy Eating and Exercise Practices Survey (CalCHEEPS). These surveys are now discontinued. Adults, adolescents, and children (with parental assistance) were asked about the sugar-sweetened beverages they drank over the previous 24 hour period. Child/Adolescent: Fruit and vegetable, beverage, and junk food consumption, along with physical activity, sedentary time, active transport, sport participation, school environment, home neighborhood environment, fruit and vegetable access and availability, household/family rules, weight status, school breakfast/lunch participation, attitudes, and beliefs. Adult: Fruit and vegetable, beverage, and junk food consumption, along with physical activity, sedentary time, worksite environment, school environment, home neighborhood environment, fruit and vegetable access and availability, household/family rules, weight status and weight loss practices, and food security. According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010, sugar-sweetened beverages provide excess calories and few essential nutrients to the diet and should only be consumed when nutrient needs have been met and without exceeding daily calorie limits.",

    "description": "<font color='#000000' face='Times New Roman' size='3'>The National Center for Education Statistics' (NCES) Education Demographic and Geographic Estimate (EDGE) program develops annually updated point locations (latitude and longitude) for public elementary and secondary schools included in the NCES Common Core of Data (CCD). The CCD program annually collects administrative and fiscal data about all public schools, school districts, and state education agencies in the United States. The data are supplied by state education agency officials and include basic directory and contact information for schools and school districts, as well as characteristics about student demographics, number of teachers, school grade span, and various other administrative conditions. CCD school and agency point locations are derived from reported information about the physical location of schools and agency administrative offices. The point locations and administrative attributes in this data layer represent the most current CCD collection.

    "description": "This dataset contains percent preterm and very preterm live births by race/ethnic group of mother. Preterm births are all live births less than 37 weeks of gestation. Very preterm births are all live births less than 32 weeks of gestation. Important growth and development occur throughout pregnancy, especially in the final months and weeks. There is a higher risk of serious disability or death the earlier a baby is born. Gestational age is based on obstetric estimate at delivery (OE). Data includes births with gestational age of 17-47 weeks.  Note: The race and ethnic groups in this table utilize eight mutually exclusive race and ethnicity categories. These categories are Hispanic and the following Non-Hispanic categories of Multi-Race, African-American, American Indian (includes Eskimo and Aleut), Asian, Pacific Islander (includes Hawaiian), White (includes Other race) and Unknown (includes refused to state and missing).                                                                                                 \r\n\r\nData should not be compared to other data where gestational age is based on the date of last normal menses (LMP) and not OE. The National Center for Health Statistics recently transitioned to using an OE-based gestational age measure due to increasing evidence  of its greater validity compared with the LMP-based measure.

    "title": "Coastal Digital Elevation Models (DEMs)",
    "description": "Digital elevation models (DEMs) of U.S. and other coasts that typically integrate ocean bathymetry and land topography. The DEMs support NOAA's mission to understand and predict changes in Earth's environment, and conserve and manage coastal and marine resources to meet our Nation's economic, social, and environmental needs. NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) has built many of these models, and also distributes DEMs on behalf of other NOAA offices, as well national and international partners. Bathymetric, topographic, and shoreline data used in DEM development come from a variety of sources, including NOAA's National Ocean Service (NOS) and NCEI, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), as well as other federal, state, and local government agencies, academic institutions, and private companies. The DEMs are referenced to a variety of vertical tidal datums, typically mean high water (MHW) or North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88), and usually a horizontal datum of North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83) or World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84). DEM cell sizes range from high-resolution models (1/9 to 1/3 arc-second; ~3 to 10 meters) that support coastal inundation studies, to regional models (roughly 3 to 24 arc-seconds) that extend farther offshore, to global models (1 arc-minute; ~2 km).",

    "title": "2022 Cartographic Boundary File (SHP), Current Census Tract for United States, 1:500,000",
    "description": "The 2022 cartographic boundary shapefiles are simplified representations of selected geographic areas from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). These boundary files are specifically designed for small-scale thematic mapping. When possible, generalization is performed with the intent to maintain the hierarchical relationships among geographies and to maintain the alignment of geographies within a file set for a given year. Geographic areas may not align with the same areas from another year. Some geographies are available as nation-based files while others are available only as state-based files.\n\nCensus tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and were defined by local participants as part of the 2020 Census Participant Statistical Areas Program. The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses. Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline. Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some states and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses. State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy. In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas. These noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves noncontiguous. For the 2010 Census and beyond, the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced for census tracts that include a majority American Indian population according to Census 2000 data and/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized American Indian reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands; the code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for those census tracts that contained little or no population and represented a relatively large special land use area such as a National Park, military installation, or a business/industrial park; and the code range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for those census tracts that contained only water area, no land area.",

    "description": "The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB).  The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.\nThe TIGER/Line shapefiles include both incorporated places (legal entities) and census designated places or CDPs (statistical entities).  An incorporated place is established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil division (MCD), which generally is created to provide services or administer an area without regard, necessarily, to population.  Places always nest within a state, but may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries.  An incorporated place usually is a city, town, village, or borough, but can have other legal descriptions.  CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places.  CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name, but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the state in which they are located.  The boundaries for CDPs often are defined in partnership with state, local, and/or tribal officials and usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity.  CDP boundaries often change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern and development; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary.  The only population/housing size requirement for CDPs is that they must contain some housing and population.\nThe boundaries of most incorporated places in this shapefile are as of January 1, 2022, as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).  The boundaries of all CDPs were delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP) for the 2020 Census, but some CDPs were added or updated through the 2022 BAS as well.",

For a more detailed description,  please go to https://tas.chicago.gov, click the About button at the bottom of the page, and then the MAP LAYERS tab.\n\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago’s arterial streets (nonfreeway\nstreets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every ten minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimate by traffic segments gives the observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic.\n\nTraffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O’Hare airport area).\nThis dataset contains the current estimated speed for about 1250 segments covering 300 miles of arterial roads.\nThere is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent\nintersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates\ntogether may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.",

The POWER Data Archive provides data at the native resolution of the source data products. The data is updated nightly to maintain Near Real Time (NRT) availability (2-3 days for meteorological parameters and 5-7 days for solar).\n\nThe POWER Project targets three specific user communities: Renewable Energy (RE), Sustainable Buildings (SB), and Agroclimatology (AG). The POWER Projects provides community specific parameters, output formats, naming conventions, and units that are commonly employed by each user community.\n\nThe POWER Services Catalog consists of a series of RESTful Application Programming Interfaces (API), geospatial enabled image services, and a web mapping Data Access Viewer (DAV). These three different service offerings support data discovery, access, and distribution to our user base as ARD and as direct application inputs to decision support tools.",

    "description": "The Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) is a biennial (i.e., every other school year) survey required by the U.S. Department of Education’s (Department) Office for Civil Rights (OCR) since 1968. The CRDC collects a variety of information including student enrollment and educational programs and services, most of which is disaggregated by race/ethnicity, sex, limited English proficiency, and disability. The CRDC is a longstanding and important aspect of the ED Office for Civil Rights (OCR) overall strategy for administering and enforcing the civil rights statutes for which it is responsible.\n\nData was reported directly from the school districts to the Office of Civil Rights. This data process is not managed by OSPI and therefore the data is not validated or reviewed by OSPI before being reported to OCR. For this reason data presented in this file will not mirror OSPI reports on similar student and school measures. \n\nIn some cases data was unavailable or suppressed by OCR to protect student privacy, for more information on this please visit the CRDC webpage. In addition, directory information for some schools is incomplete, as the names of the organizations provided in the CRDC data files did not match the names of organizations on record with OSPI.\n\nFor additional information or questions about this data please visit the CRDC webpage at https://ocrdata.ed.gov/.",

    "description": "Distributes NIST estimate of official U.S. time over the Internet in real time, using Network Time Protocol (NTP) and other time data formats to automatically synchronize clocks in computers and network devices to official U.S. time as realized by NIST several billions of times per day. This official U.S. time is the NIST estimate of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and called UTC(NIST). The accuracy of UTC(NIST) as distributed through the Internet Time Service (ITS) is on the order of 0.001 seconds (one millisecond), although accuracy can vary depending on network conditions and other parameters. Note that unlike most traditional datasets, time is intrinsically a transient, ever-changing quantity. As soon as UTC(NIST) is transmitted to a client, that particular value of UTC(NIST) no longer reflects the current time, which is constantly changing. There is thus no static storage of any time data, apart from internal diagnostic information not released to the public which ensures that UTC(NIST) as disseminated through the Internet Time Service (ITS) is commensurate with the official UTC(NIST) realization within the uncertainties of the system. The vast majority of UTC(NIST) information distributed through ITS is provided freely, anonymously and automatically to the public. Any IP address can request UTC(NIST) through the ITS and the information is automatically and anonymously provided at no cost to the user. Full documentation of the ITS including all the source code is available to the public through the web site http://www.nist.gov/pml/div688/.NIST provides an authenticated version of ITS to a limited number of users (approximately 500 users near the end of calendar year 2015) who for various reasons want to ensure they are receiving UTC(NIST) without spoofing or interference with the information. This service uses public key encryption for the set of registered users to provide authenticated UTC(NIST).",

    "title": "Cobalt Deposits in the United States",
    "description": "This data release provides descriptions of more than 60 mineral regions, mines, and mineral deposits within the United States and its territories that are reported to contain enrichments of cobalt (Co). To focus the scope of this data release, we report only mined deposits and exploration prospects with past production, or resource and reserve estimates of 1,000 metric tons or more of cobalt. \nCobalt has diverse uses because of its properties, which include ferromagnetism, hardness, wear-resistance, low conductivity, and high melting point. The primary uses for cobalt are in rechargeable battery electrodes, and in superalloys used to make gas turbine engines. In 2017, the United States had a net import reliance as a percentage of apparent consumption of 72 percent for cobalt, and cobalt is considered a critical mineral. \nCobalt mineralogy is diverse; it occurs in a variety of sulfide, arsenide, sulfarsenide, and oxyhydroxide minerals. In the United States, cobalt could be derived as a byproduct from mineral deposits that primarily produce other metals, including nickel, copper, zinc, and lead. \nThe inclusion of a particular mineral deposit or prospect in this database is not meant to imply that it has economic potential. Rather, these entries were included to capture the characteristics of the deposits and prospects in the United States and its territories that have the largest cobalt resources. These deposits and prospects occur in Alaska, California, Idaho, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, North Carolina, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico and Tennessee. \nSeveral deposits and prospects were not included in this database, because they contain less than 1,000 metric tons of cobalt. A prime example is the Bunkerville project in Nevada (Ludington and others, 2006).  \nThe Stillwater deposit in Montana produced cobalt, but this was a byproduct, and to our knowledge, there are no published records of the amount of cobalt produced, or the amount of cobalt contained within the deposit. Analyses of rock chips from 47 outcrops of the Katahdin deposit in Maine indicates that the deposit locally contains approximately 0.1 percent cobalt (Miller, 1945), but a thorough analysis of the deposit is lacking.  \nMine La Motte in Missouri and the Stone Corral project in California were not included because of a lack of ore reserve information in publicly available references. However, we are aware that cobalt is present in the area and we welcome further information on these sites.\nThe entries and descriptions in the database were derived from published papers, reports, data, and internet documents, published from 1908 to 2018, representing a variety of sources, including geologic and exploration studies described in State, Federal, and industry reports. Although an attempt was made to capture as many examples as possible, this dataset is a progress report that is part of an ongoing effort. The authors welcome additional published information in order to continually update and refine this dataset.",

    "title": "Fish Detection AI, sonar image-trained detection, counting, tracking models",
    "description": "The Fish Detection AI project aims to improve the efficiency of fish monitoring around marine energy facilities to comply with regulatory requirements. Despite advancements in computer vision, there is limited focus on sonar images, identifying small fish with unlabeled data, and methods for underwater fish monitoring for marine energy.\n\nA Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) was developed using sonar images from Alaska Fish and Games to identify, track, and count fish in underwater environments. Supervised methods were used with Faster R-CNN to detect fish based on training using labeled data of fish. Customized filters were specifically applied to detect and count small fish when labeled datasets were unavailable. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation techniques were implemented to enable trained models to be applied to different unseen datasets, reducing the need for labeling datasets and training new models for various locations. Additionally, elastic shape analysis (ESA), hyper-image analysis, and various image preprocessing methods were explored to enhance fish detection.\n\nIn this research we achieved:\n1.\tFaster R-CNN for Sonar images\n- Applied Faster R-CNN reached > 0.85 average precision (AP) for large fish detection, providing robust results for higher-quality sonar images.\n- Integrated Norfair tracking to reduce double-counting of fish across video frames, enabling more accurate population estimates.\n2.\tSmall Fish Identification\n- Established customized filtering methods for small, often unlabeled fish in noisy acoustic images.\n\nThis submission of data includes several sub-directories:\n- FryCounting: contains information on how to count small fish (i.e., fry) in the sonar image data\n- SG_aldi_addons: contains additions to the ALDI code (SG = Steven Gutstein, primary author) such as the trained models used in this experiment, which should match the models achieved when the training instructions are followed, and code for how to make the sonar images into movies\n- Summaries_Dir: contains information on how to set up the foundation to perform these experiments, such as installing all required packages and versions, and creating the PyTorch and ALDI environments\n\nThese experiments boil down to a 2-part structure as described in the uploaded readme file:\n\nPart I: Installing and Using ALDI & Norfair Code\n-\tThis is used for tracking and counting fish, and is a replication of the article that is linked, namely the Align and Distill (Aldi) work done by Justin Kay and others\n-\tThis part relates to the Summaries_Dir subfolder, and the SG_aldi_addons sub-folder\n\nPart II: Installing and Using Fry Code\n-\tThis is used to track and count smaller fish (aka fry)\n-\tThis relates to the FryCounting sub-directory\nAlso included here are links to the downloadable sonar data and the article that was replicated in this study.",

DCJS compiles these reports as New York's official crime statistics and submits them to the FBI under the National Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program. UCR uses standard offense definitions to count crime in localities across America regardless of variations in crime laws from state to state. In New York State, law enforcement agencies use the UCR system to report their monthly crime totals to DCJS. The UCR reporting system collects information on seven crimes classified as Index offenses which are most commonly used to gauge overall crime volume. These include the violent crimes of murder/non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault; and the property crimes of burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft. Police agencies may experience reporting problems that preclude accurate or complete reporting. The counts represent only crimes reported to the police but not total crimes that occurred.  DCJS posts preliminary data in the spring and final data in the fall.",

Location is -155.291162, 19.420972 (NAD83), elevation 1257 m.  Data has two orientations for each time sample (north and east).  Each file contains a year of data.  The original datasource removes the mean, so the ends of subsequent files will not align.  The absolute value of tilt has little value, so the user should manually shift the records by a constant if alignment is required between year files.",

    "description": "Effective April 1, 2022, the Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office no longer takes jurisdiction over hospital, nursing home or hospice COVID-19 deaths unless there is another factor that falls within the Office’s jurisdiction. Data continues to be collected for COVID-19 deaths in Cook County on the Illinois Dept. of Public Health COVID-19 dashboard (https://dph.illinois.gov/covid19/data.html).\n\nThis contains information about deaths that occurred in Cook County that were under the Medical Examiner’s jurisdiction. Not all deaths that occur in Cook County are reported to the Medical Examiner or fall under the jurisdiction of the Medical Examiner. The Medical Examiner’s Office determines cause and manner of death for those cases that fall under its jurisdiction. Cause of death describes the reason the person died. This dataset includes information from deaths starting in August 2014 to the present, with information updated daily.\n\nChanges:\nDecember 16, 2022: The Cook County Commissioner District field now reflects the boundaries that went into effect December 5, 2022.\n\nSeptember 8, 2023: The Primary Cause field is now a combination of the Primary Cause Line A, Line B, and Line C fields.",

The rates and trends were estimated using a Bayesian spatiotemporal model and a smoothed over space, time, and demographic group. Rates are age-standardized in 10-year age groups using the 2010 US population. Data source: National Vital Statistics System.",
