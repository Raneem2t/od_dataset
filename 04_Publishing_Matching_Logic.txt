## 🔍 Matching Logic Between Global Open Data and Local Scope

This file outlines the logic used to match global datasets with the strategic scope of the local entity.

---

## 🌐 Global Dataset Repository

Contains over 1.8 million records from global platforms (e.g., data.gov, data.europa.eu, etc.).

---

## 🎯 Matching Goals

- Identify datasets already published globally that overlap with the entity’s strategic domains.
- Filter and prioritize datasets that align with national objectives and local needs.

---

## 🧮 Matching Steps

### Step 1: Preprocessing Global Records
- Extract and normalize metadata: title, description, tags, publisher, topics.
- Translate metadata to English where applicable.

### Step 2: Strategic Keyword Filtering
- Use curated list of keywords from `03_Publishing_Strategy_Routing.txt`.
- Discard datasets with no overlap in domain relevance.

### Step 3: Similarity Scoring
- Compute similarity between global dataset metadata and domain keywords using:
  - TF-IDF + cosine similarity
  - BERT embedding similarity (if available)

### Step 4: Priority Boosters
Apply score boosts for:
- Datasets published by >3 countries
- High download or reuse count (if available)
- Matches multiple strategic pillars
- Matches previous internal publishing interest

### Step 5: Final Filtering
- Remove duplicates
- Apply publishing eligibility criteria (non-sensitive, open license, not already published)

## 📌 Matching Output

Each match includes:
- Global dataset title and link
- Similarity score
- Suggested strategic objective(s)
- Notes on why it’s relevant for local publishing

## 🧠 Use Case

Use this logic to generate intelligent, evidence-backed publishing suggestions from a noisy, global dataset pool.
