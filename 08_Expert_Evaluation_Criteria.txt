## ðŸ§ª Expert Evaluation Criteria

This file defines the evaluation metrics used to assess the quality and alignment of use cases and insights generated by each expert in the MoE model.

Each output should be scored using the following criteria:

---

## ðŸ“Š Evaluation Dimensions

### 1. Strategic Alignment (Weight: 30%)
- Does the use case clearly support one or more of the 100 strategic objectives?
- Is the link between the use case and objective(s) explained and justified?

Scoring:
- 5 = Strong alignment and well-justified
- 3 = Some alignment but vague justification
- 1 = Weak or no alignment

---

### 2. Usefulness & Value (Weight: 25%)
- Does the use case solve a meaningful problem or enable valuable insight?
- Will it help improve decision-making, innovation, or sustainability?

Scoring:
- 5 = Highly valuable and practical
- 3 = Moderately useful
- 1 = Low relevance or generic

---

### 3. Clarity & Structure (Weight: 15%)
- Is the use case clearly written and structured?
- Are all required template fields filled out meaningfully?

Scoring:
- 5 = Clear and well-formatted
- 3 = Some parts unclear
- 1 = Poorly structured or incomplete

---

### 4. Domain Relevance (Weight: 20%)
- Was the correct expert selected for this dataset?
- Is the insight specific to the expertâ€™s role and capabilities?

Scoring:
- 5 = Highly domain-specific
- 3 = Somewhat generic
- 1 = Irrelevant or out of scope

---

### 5. Innovation & Creativity (Weight: 10%)
- Is the use case original, novel, or forward-looking?
- Does it bring a fresh approach or unlock new opportunities?

Scoring:
- 5 = Innovative and unique
- 3 = Reasonable but standard
- 1 = Repetitive or basic

---

## ðŸ§® Overall Scoring Formula

`Score = (AÃ—0.3) + (BÃ—0.25) + (CÃ—0.15) + (DÃ—0.2) + (EÃ—0.1)`

Where:
- A = Strategic Alignment
- B = Value
- C = Clarity
- D = Domain Relevance
- E = Innovation
